description = "Hatari emulator for libretro. This core supports Atari's 16-/32-bit ST/STE/TT/Falcon hardware and tries to emulate the hardware as closely as possible, so it can support most of the old Atari games and demos. The core requires a TOS image to function. This core is a good option for most users on a modern device."
