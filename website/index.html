<h2>About:</h2>
<p>
Welcome to the Hatari web site!
<br />
Hatari is an Atari ST/STE/TT/Falcon emulator for GNU/Linux, BSD,
Mac OS X, Windows and other systems which are supported by the
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">SDL library</a>.
The Atari ST was a 16/32 bit computer system which was first released by Atari
in 1985. Using the Motorola 68000 CPU, it was a very popular computer having
quite a lot of CPU power at that time.
Unlike many other Atari ST emulators which try to give you a good
environment for running GEM applications, Hatari tries to emulate the hardware
of a ST as close as possible so that it is able to run most of the old ST games
and demos.
Hatari is open source software and is distributed under the terms of the
GNU General Public License (GPL).
<br />
The project page is available at:
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/hatari/">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/hatari/</a>
</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<p>
Hatari supports the emulation of most of the ST and STE hardware, including some
special tricks like raster interrupts, border effects and PSG sample sound.
A joystick can be emulated with the cursor keys or with a real PC joystick.
Hatari also features the possibility to &quot;mount&quot; a directory of the
host system as a ST drive, or to use images from an original Atari's hard disk.
<br />
Note that Hatari mainly emulates the original ST and STE hardware &ndash;
the emulation of the additional hardware of the TT or Falcon machines is
currently in development and experimental (but DSP and DMA sound are
improving on a regular basis).
</p>

<h2>System requirements:</h2>
<p>
First you need a fast machine (500MHz or more for ST/STE emulation,
&gt; 1.5 GHz for Falcon emulation) which is running a Unix compatible OS
(preferably GNU/Linux) that supports the SDL library.
There are also some ports to other operating systems like BeOS, please see
the <a href="links.html">links page</a> for more information.
Non-Linux systems like FreeBSD etc. are rarely tested, so if you run into
problems while compiling Hatari on such platforms, please let us know!
</p>
<p>
Have a look at the <a href="download.html">downloads page</a> for details
about the required libraries and available packages.
Some binary packages are now available, too, but not for all architectures.
So you might need to also have GNU C on your system to recompile the source
code of Hatari.
</p>
<p>
Before you can finally run the emulator, you also need a TOS image file.
TOS is the built-in operating system of the Atari 16/32 bit computers.
Since it is not possible to ship one of these image files with Hatari,
you either have to create your own image from your Atari or you have to
use <a href="http://emutos.sourceforge.net/en/">EmuTOS</a>, a free TOS
replacement.
</p>
<p>
Certain versions of Hatari have successfully been tested by various people on
the following systems:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux 2.6.x is the prefered platform (most developers use this OS)</li>
<li>Apple PowerMac with Mac OS X</li>
<li>NetBSD 1.6</li>
<li>NetBSD on a Digital Alpha</li>
<li>FreeBSD 4.1 on a i486 computer, FreeBSD 4.8 on a Pentium 4
    and FreeBSD 5.1</li>
<li>OpenBSD 3.5</li>
<li>Solaris 8 on a SUN UltraSparc 1 (64-bit mode)</li>
<li>Sharp Zaurus SL-C760 PDA running Linux</li>
<li>Nokia N770, N800, N810 internet tablets running Linux 2.6</li>
<li>Acorn RISC OS machines</li>
<li>Amiga OS 4</li>
<li>FreeMiNT on Aranym</li>
<li>Windows XP</li>
<li>BeOS/i86</li>
</ul>
