# Keymap. This format allows you to associate SDL key descriptions with
# scancodes simulating the corresponding keys pressed on the emulated ST.
#
# Format is the following:
# <host_description>,<guest_description>
#
# <host_description> is the scancode of the key pressed (which you can see
# when running hatari with the "--trace keymap" option). 
# Optionally you can:
# * Add a SDL key modifier (see https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Keymod#Related_Functions)
# * Add a modifier mask. This mask will be bitwise "AND"'ed to the
#   actual key pressed before it is compared with items from this keymap.
#   This allows to mask out e.g. NumLock to make mappings work regardless 
#   of the status of that modifier.
# All these (scancode, modifiers, mask) must appear in this order and be
# separated by a pipe |.
#
# <guest_description> is the pipe-separated ordered list of scancodes to send
# to the ST (4 max). For convenience you can use LSHIFT, RSHIFT and
# ALTERNATE in lieu of 2a,36,38 respectively.
# You can find scancodes in many Atari documentation places, e.g.
# https://tho-otto.de/keyboards/
# or https://freemint.github.io/tos.hyp/en/scancode.html
#
# Notes:
# * All scan codes must be in hexadecimal.
# * The parser is not very smart so don't add spaces etc.
# * Make the narrowest specification appear first.

# Mapping with SHIFT keys and mask (LSHIFT) to mask out other modifiers
# like Numlock, so these mapping (for left and right shift) will work
# regardless of Numlock
