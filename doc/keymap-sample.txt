# This is an example for a keyboard mapping file that can be used in Hatari
# by loading it from the keyboard setup dialog.
#
# Lines starting with a '#' or with a ';' are comments.
# All other lines should contain exactly two numbers separated by a comma.
#
# The first number is the symbolic PC key code (see the SDL_keysym.h file
# from the SDL library header files which can usually be found in the
# folder /usr/include/SDL/).
#
# The corresponding key will be mapped to the ST key which is specified by
# second number - the ST scan code of the key (see src/keymap.c in the Hatari
# sources).
#
# tests/keymap/ directory contains programs to discover/test the PC SDL
# and Atari scan code values.
#
# Example: If you want to get the 'y' and 'z' keys right with a german TOS
# ROM, you can use the following two lines to map the PC keys to the right
# ST scan codes:
