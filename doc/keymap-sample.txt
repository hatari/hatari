# This is an example for a keyboard mapping file that can be used in Hatari
# by loading it from the keyboard setup dialog.
#
# Lines starting with a '#' or with a ';' are comments. All other lines
# should contain exactly one key name and a scancode, separated by a comma.
#
# The key name is the libSDL symbolic name of the key, see the following
# URL for a list: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Keycode
# You can also use the symbolic keycode value instead of the name,
# which you can get with the "--trace keymap" output from Hatari, for
# example, but note that the values are different between SDL1 and SDL2
# and thus they are not portable.
#
# The given host key will be mapped to the ST key which is specified by
# second number - the ST scan code of the key.  "--trace keymap" output
# shows the already mapped scan code.
#
# tests/keymap/ directory contains programs to discover/test the PC SDL
# and Atari scan code values.  Hatari's default PC key code -> ST scan
# code mappings are in src/keymap.c source file.
#
# Example: If you want to get the 'y' and 'z' keys right with a german TOS
# ROM, you can use the following two lines to map the PC keys to the right
# ST scan codes:
Y,44
Z,21
