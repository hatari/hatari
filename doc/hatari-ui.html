<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hatari UI is an out-of-process user interface for the Hatari
emulator and its built-in debugger which can (optionally) embed the
Hatari emulator window. Having the UI in another process allows doing
it with a higher level language and avoiding adding GUI toolkit
dependencies to Hatari itself.</p>

<p>The UI is done with PyGtk i.e. in Python language, using the Gtk
widget set.  it is an additional UI, the built-in Hatari SDL UI is not
being replaced or going anywhere!</p>


<h3>Why another UI?</h3>

<p>While the built-in SDL UI for Hatari has its good points,
it has also many minor shortcomings:
<ul>
<li>There is no UI for the debugger or for viewing trace/debug logs.</li>
<li>The configuration UI itself is not configurable and although its
    quite nice for an UI done with C and libSDL, it is still very hard
    to modify (e.g. its layout).
</li>
<li>It does not currently support UTF-8 or internationalization and is not
    scalable enough to support localization well (translations need
    up to 1/3 more space).
</li>
<li>The file selector does not support unicode (all file systems use
    nowadays Unicode file names) nor bookmarks or other goodies in
    modern file selectors.
</li>
<li>Invoking the UI stops the emulation.</li>
<li>It does not allow configuring all the things that one can configure
    e.g. from command line (Spec512, fast forward, Falcon DSP settings,
    trace settings and bios-tracing, log files and levels).
</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see from the <a href="#screenshots">screenshots</a>,
the features offered by the new UI are nice also on desktops, but
the configurability is especially important for devices that have
constrained input methods; limited set of keys and e.g. high DPI
touchscreen. Something like this UI is really a must on devices with
no right or middlebutton, where use of stylus or finger makes
double clicks hard because the pixels are so small that hitting
the same place twice is not easy and which lacks standard Atari
keys.</p>

<p>One of the targets for the UI configurability and features
was Nokia N8x0 (Linux) devices with 226 DPI 800x480 touchscreen and
limited number of keys. This reflects slightly in the UI design too.
For example text pasting is done in separate dialog instead of in
an inline control and one can easily add buttons for synthetizing
specific key presses.</p>


<h3>Current features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Besides the UI menu, user can specify whether there are toolbars,
    where they are (on left, right, top or bottom, or in a separate
    panel window) and what controls the toolbars have (from
    a predefined set).
</li>
<li>Optional support for embedding the Hatari window (UI keyboard
    shortcuts would prevent those keys from being used with Hatari
    so keyboard shortcuts are disabled when Hatari window is embedded).
</li>
<li>User can specify buttons which synthetize specified text strings
    or Atari keycodes to the emulator.  There is also a dialog for
    pasting text (e.g. from other programs) to Hatari.
</li>
<li>An UI for the Hatari debugger and dialog for changing
    the emulation tracing points at run time.
</li>
<li>An ability to pause Hatari completely.<br>
    (SDL UI cannot do this because SDL does constant polling even when
    Hatari is completely idle; on OSX this prevents screensaver from
    starting and on laptops it drains the battery.)
</li>
<li>Support all main options that can affect Hatari speed (frameskip,
    fastforward, spec512 and sound) without a need to reset the emulation
    and dialogs for configuring the other main Hatari options (which
    require reset).
</li>
<li>Gtk file selector used for floppies, harddisks, ROMs etc.</li>
<li>Saving and loading Hatari configurations (user can have multiple
    setups between which he can switch such as STE+color for demos vs.
    TT+mono for applications).
</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="#screenshots">screenshots</a> for more details.


<h3>Potential future features</h3>

<p>There are several other features that would be nice in the new UI:
<ul>
<li>Support for less often used Hatari options.</li>
<li>Multiple views to registers, emulated memory areas or disassembly which
    are refreshed by the debugger UI each time the emulator is stopped.
</li>
<li>Debugger breakpoint support.</li>
<li>Trace/debug log view window with log level controls.</li>
<li>Saving/loading the configuration for Hatari <b>UI</b> itself.</li>
<li>Saving Hatari configuration changes to separate file
    from configuration file Hatari normally reads.
</li>
<li>UI internationalization and localization (after somebody asks for it).
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Known issues</h3>

<p>There are some issues which cannot be handled in an external UI
(without additional support from Hatari):
<ul>
<li>Hatari window embedding to the Hatari UI window is done by telling
    Hatari to reparent its SDL framebuffer X11 window under (given)
    Hatari UI window XID.  Therefore embedding will only work under
    X11, not under Wayland (even Xwayland), Mac or Windows.
</li>
<li>Hatari UI does not notice nor adapt if user changes Hatari
    configuration options from within Hatari itself (as Hatari does not
    currently tell about them).  This is not very serious issue as
    with Hatari UI, the configuration changes are supposed
    to be done through it, not by using the internal Hatari UI.
</li>
<li>To take Machine setup "Use harddisk" option disabling into
    use, it is not enough to reboot the emulation. You need to
    re-run Hatari as Hatari does not support doing that externally
    at run-time.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Getting Hatari UI</h2>

<p>Hatari is available from major Linux distributions and Hatari UI
is included with it.

The latest version can be found from the Hatari Git repository:
<a href="https://framagit.org/hatari/hatari/-/tree/main/python-ui">https://framagit.org/hatari/hatari/-/tree/main/python-ui</a>


<h3>Portability</h3>

<p>Besides Linux, the UI could eventually be used even on Windows
by first installing the PyGtk dependencies listed on (otherwise unrelated)
<a href="http://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=Windows_installer#Installation">Gramps
application Windows dependencies</a> page.  Additionally the Hatari
control socket code needs to be ported to Windows (i.e. use WinSock
or have proper Cygwin build of Hatari with unix domain socket support).
</p>

<p>Mac should not be a problem, under its UI glitz it is mostly BSD unix.</p>


<h2 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h2>

<h3>Current UI screenshot</h3>

<p>Current Hatari UI uses standard Gtk menu and toolbars
instead of the button boxes used in older versions.  You can still
configure the buttons included to the top / bottom / left / right
of the Hatari screen though.</p>

<p>Hatari UI with the About dialog open:</p>
<img alt="Hatari UI" src="images/hatari-ui-0.9.png">

<p>Options:<pre>
hatari-ui.py --embed --right "about,|,run,pause,forward,|,reset,|,quit"
</pre>


<h3>Screenshots for older versions</h3>

<p>While the older UI is bit different, these option examples and their
screenshots show how to specify elements and their layout for the
Hatari Python UI.

You can have as many panels as you wish.  For each panel you need to add
a control with the name of the panel (see "MyPanel" below).

For example:
	hatariui.py --embed \
	--top "about,run,pause,quit" \
	--panel "MyPanel,Macro=Test,Undo=97,Help=98,&gt;,F1=59,F2=60,F3=61,F4=62,&gt;,close" \
	--right "MyPanel,debug,trace,machine" \
	--bottom "sound,|,forward,|,full,|,quit"

if no options are given, the UI uses basic controls.

<h3 id="keycodes">Keycodes</h3>

<p>To configure the keys, you need Atari keycode map matching your TOS
language / version.  Thorsten Otto has documented them here:
