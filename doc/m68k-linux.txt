1. Introduction
---------------

Here are instructions on building m68k Linux:
- kernel
- ramdisk
- root file system

And using them with Hatari.

Build instructions are for Debian as that is the only Linux distribution
still building latest SW package versions for m68k, in ports:
	http://ftp.ports.debian.org/debian-ports/pool-m68k/main/

But m68k gcc is available also on other distributions, along with
tools for building the images (from packages in Debian ports).


1.1 Notation
------------

In examples, different execution environments are indicated by prompts:
	$ -- shell prompt
	# -- root shell prompt
	> -- Hatari debugger prompt

"wget" examples do not give exact package names because versions in
them change frequently. Replace "*" in those file names with the
version available in the given remote directory!


2. Hatari issues
----------------

- LILO reset code has not yet been updated from Aranym's Falcon
  AfterBurner behavior to normal Falcon (they use different reset
  addresses), so resets fail with LILO

- PC address points to ST-RAM in debugger even for emulated Linux
  code running in TT-RAM, because it is not MMU-translated
  => workaround: load Linux to ST-RAM when debugging/profiling

- There are lot of ("--log-level debug" and profiler) warnings about
  memory accesses to >2GB range when programs do syscalls. An issue
  with Hatari high address memory setup, or another symptom of
  missing MMU-translation within Hatari?
  DEBUG: Your Atari program just did something terribly stupid: dummy_xlate($c00123ee)

- Hatari does not implement VME/SCU interrupt handling although it by
  default allows access to related registers, and as result Linux
  freezes at boot on MegaSTE / TT
  => workaround: use Hatari "--vme none" option with them

- Incomplete TT / SCSI / 2nd MFP emulation:
  => workaround: have TT root file system on IDE master or slave

  Rootfs mount from SCSI device fails after following debug output:

------------------------------------------------------------

- Oops on kernel boot in init (Busybox shell) when either 030 CPU
  cache or prefetch emulation is enabled, resulting in kernel panic.
  According to kernel developer, there are no panics on real HW, so
  they seem to be Hatari issue.

  Whether 24-bit or 32-bit addressing (and TT-RAM) is needed, does
  not affect the issue.

  Kernel gives same backtrace on 030 (Mega)ST(e), TT and Falcon,
  regardless of whether it is started with LILO, or by native
  bootstrap program:

------------------------------------------------------------


3. Building m68k kernel
-----------------------

0. Install generic build tools:
   $ sudo apt install bc bison flex

1. Install compiler:
   $ sudo apt install gcc-m68k-linux-gnu

2. Get latest upstream kernel release sources (without history):
   $ git clone --depth 1 --branch v6.4 \
     git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
   $ cd linux

3. Apply Linux issue workaround patches:
   $ git am /path/to/hatari/tools/linux/000*.patch

4. Get Hatari compatible configuration:
   $ cp /path/to/hatari/tools/linux/kernel.config .config

5. Compile configured kernel:
   $ ARCH=m68k CROSS_COMPILE=m68k-linux-gnu- make -j4 vmlinux

Notes:

- You can fine-tune kernel config for your requirements with:
   $ ARCH=m68k CROSS_COMPILE=m68k-linux-gnu- make -j4 menuconfig

- Using "optimize for size" instead of "optimize for performance"
  reduced (stripped) kernel image by ~15%

- Normal Linux builds require 030 (or better) with MMU and FPU
  (only uCLinux would work on 68000 without MMU)

- Using included kernel.config file as-is, builds non-modular kernel
  that includes all relevant features for mounting root fs directly.
  It saves bootup time compared to using initramfs for loading the
  needed external modules

- Bootup works faster when kernel is uncompressed, as uncompression
  would happen in emulated code => do not compress kernel


4. Building root file system
----------------------------

This is common part for both examples below (if you already have
a directory named disk/, rename it, or use another name).

1. Create root file system directories:
   $ mkdir disk
   $ cd disk
   $ mkdir -p dev etc mnt proc run sys tmp sbin usr/bin usr/sbin root

2. Add minimal init script for mounting virtual file systems
   before starting shell:
   $ cp -a /path/to/hatari/tools/linux/init.sh init

3. Add a user:
   $ echo "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh" > etc/passwd

4. And basic terminal descriptions:
   $ cp -ar /lib/terminfo/ lib/


4.1 As EXT2 HD image, from BusyBox
----------------------------------

This builds a minimal hard disk root file system with BusyBox.

BusyBox is a multi-call binary, which performs the same job as many
separate programs, based on the (symlink) name with which it is
invoked. For more info, see "man busybox" (after installing BusyBox to
host).

5. Fetch statically linked m68k BusyBox and extract it:
   $ wget http://ftp.ports.debian.org/debian-ports/pool-m68k/main/b/busybox/busybox-static_*_m68k.deb
   $ ar x busybox-static_*_m68k.deb
   $ tar xvf data.tar.xz ./bin/busybox

6. Install host BusyBox and add symlinks for the m68k one to bin/
   directory, based on what tools host one lists to be included:
   $ sudo apt install busybox
   $ /path/to/hatari/tools/linux/symlink-busybox.sh

7. Cleanup directory content:
   $ rm *.* debian-binary
   $ cd ..

8. Make 4MB EXT2 HD image out of it:
   $ /sbin/mkfs.ext2 -t ext2 -L BUSYBOX -d disk/ rootfs.img 4M

TODO:
- After qemu-m68k user-space emulation is good enough, installation of
  host BusyBox can be skipped and m68k BusyBox can itself be queried
  for list of tools to symlink


4.2 As EXT2 HD image, from klibc utils
--------------------------------------

This builds a minimal hard disk root file system with kernel "libc"
utilities intended for initramfs.  These utilities are separate
binaries (not symlinks like with BusyBox) and they're much more
limited than BusyBox; they lack many of the standard options and shell
does not e.g. have file name completion. In total they take only few
hundred KB of space though.

5. Fetch klibc library and utility packages:
   $ wget http://ftp.ports.debian.org/debian-ports/pool-m68k/main/k/klibc/libklibc_*_m68k.deb
   $ wget http://ftp.ports.debian.org/debian-ports/pool-m68k/main/k/klibc/klibc-utils_*_m68k.deb

6. Extract them:
   $ ar x libklibc_*_m68k.deb
   $ tar xvf data.tar.xz
   $ ar x klibc-utils_*_m68k.deb
   $ tar xvf data.tar.xz

7. Move utilities to bin/ and clean directory:
   $ mv usr/lib/klibc/bin/ .
   $ rm -r *.* debian-binary usr/
   $ cd ..

8. Make 4MB EXT2 HD image out of it:
   $ /sbin/mkfs.ext2 -t ext2 -L KLIBC -d disk/ rootfs.img 4M

Notes:
- these utilities would fit even to a floppy image:
	$ zip2st disk/ klibc.st
  But FAT file system cannot be used for Linux root fs because it is
  lacking security features required from one


5. Building initrd
------------------

After creating either of above root file systems, you can use the same
content also to create an example initrd / initramfs.

9. Package directory content with cpio and compress it with LZO:
   $ cd disk/
   $ find | cpio -R 0:0 -H newc --create | lzop -9 > ../initrd.img

Notes:

- *Initrd is unnecessary* when kernel includes everything needed for
  mounting the real root file system, like is the case *with the
  provided kernel.config*.  Initrd is required only if you e.g. need
  to enter password to decrypt the disk or load additional kernel
  module(s) before mounting the root file system.

- Initrd resides in / uses RAM, so you're better of mounting the real
  root fs directly.  if you're tight on memory, but still need initrd,
  minimize its size and make sure kernel can free it after pivoting
  to real root fs.

- Kernel will need to extract initrd contents from CPIO archive loaded
  to RAM.  Archive is freed after extraction, but before that a
  significant amount of extra RAM is needed for it.

- Kernel can handle both compressed and uncompressed initrd.
  Compressed initrd takes less RAM during CIO archive extraction, but
  its decompression slows boot significantly.

- Above used LZO compression provides faster decompression speed,
  gzip/deflate better compression ratio.  Both are enabled in included
  kernel.config. One can enable from kernel config extra compression
  algorithms with better compression ratios, but they are significantly
  slower.


6. Running Hatari
-----------------

1. Set suitable options in lilo.cfg, for example:
-------------------------------------
[LILO]
Kernel = vmlinux-v6.4
Symbols = System.map-v6.4
Ramdisk =
Args = video=atafb:sthigh console=tty
KernelToFastRam = FALSE
-------------------------------------
(See lilo.cfg in doc/ directory for more info.)

2. Start Hatari:
    $ hatari --log-level info \
      --fast-forward on --fastfdc on --timer-d on \
      --machine falcon --dsp none --fpu 68882 \
      --cpuclock 32 --cpu-exact off --compatible off \
      --mmu on -s 14 --ttram 64 --addr24 off \
      -c lilo.cfg --natfeats on \

2a) with root fs on disk:
      --ide-master rootfs.img \
      --lilo "debug=nfcon root=/dev/sda ro init=/init"

2b) with root fs being initrd specified in lilo.cfg:
      --lilo "debug=nfcon root=/dev/ram ro init=/init"


Options explanation (these can also be set in lilo.cfg):
- video=atafb:sthigh -- frame buffer starts in ST-high
  (mono is fastest mode with large enough resolution)
- console=tty -- console output goes to frame buffer
- debug=nfcon -- kernel debug messages go to Hatari console
- root=<device> -- what device is used for mounting root file system
- ro -- mount it read-only
- init=<path> -- run given executable / script as first process

Other notes:
- Hatari CPU cache/prefetch emulation is disabled as otherwise
  there are random bus errors & failures on Linux system calls
- Keep "init=" last on "--lilo" option kernel command line,
  otherwise kernel may give arguments after it also to init!
- Kernel does not need DSP, and avoiding it is emulation with
  "--dsp none" at least doubles "--fast-forward on" speed


7. Native bootstrap
-------------------

Real HW does not have LILO, so a separate bootstrap program is needed
for loading the kernel into RAM and executing it from there. Following
shows easiest method to simulate that with Hatari.

1. Get bootstrap program:
   $ mkdir gemdos-hd
   $ cd gemdos-hd
   $ wget https://people.debian.org/~wouter/d-i/images/20130502-06:51/tools/atari/bootstra.tos

2. Tell bootstrap program to load kernel to ST-RAM and whole command
   line to give to the kernel:
   $ echo "-s -d -k vmlinux root=/dev/sda ro debug=nfcon video=atafb:sthigh console=tty init=/init" > bootargs
   $ cd ..

3. Get kernel to bootstrap:
   $ cp /path/to/m68k-kernel/vmlinux gemdos-hd/

4. If you do not have a TOS ROM image, download latest EmuTOS release
   from:
     https://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/1.2.1/emutos-1024k-1.2.1.zip/download
   and extract it:
   $ unzip emutos-1024k-1.2.1.zip

5. Then run Hatari with them:
   $ hatari --trace os_base --log-level info \
      --tos emutos-1024k-1.2.1/etos1024k.img \
      --fast-forward on --fastfdc on --timer-d on \
      --machine falcon --dsp none --fpu 68882 \
      --cpuclock 32 --cpu-exact off --compatible off \
      --mmu on -s 14 --ttram 64 --addr24 off \
      --natfeats on --ide-master rootfs.img \
      gemdos-hd/bootstra.tos

Hatari notes:
- Because GEMDOS HD is specific to TOS, it is not accessible from Linux
- Because TOS does not have driver for the Linux disk, and GEMDOS HD
  is assigned to C:, IDE content is not accessible from TOS

On real HW:
- Linux rootfs would be put to a partition (e.g. "sda2"),
  it would not start from IDE drive first sector ("sda")
- NatFeats is not available, so debug option can be removed,
  or debug device set to a more suitable one (e.g. serial)


8. Debugging and profiling
--------------------------

There are few ways to investigate what happens at boot:
- Asking kernel to give debug output for module initializations
  with "initcall_debug" kernel command line option
- Disabling individual init calls with "initcall_blacklist=<name>"
  to see whether boot proceeds (better) without them
- Tracing kernel function calls with Hatari "trace cpu_symbols"
  debugger command and the "--trace cpu_symbols" option
- Profiling what the kernel does

Tracing and "initcall_debug" will give a lot of output so save it
also to a file:
	$ hatari ... 2>&1 | tee output.txt

Tracing and profiling both require symbols file produced during kernel
build.  If that file is listed in lilo.cfg, symbols will be automatically
loaded before Linux boots.

For now, all debugging and profiling should be done with kernel loaded
to ST-RAM (see Hatari issues section).  For that, its size needs to be
<8MB uncompressed, otherwise it wo not work from ST-RAM.

Related lilo.cfg options are:
	KernelToFastRam = FALSE
	Symbols = Symbols.map

To verify that symbols loaded correctly, one can check in debugger
e.g. whether nf_call (NatFeats entry point) looks as expected:
----------------
> d nf_call
$00008230 : 7301      DC.W      $7301
$00008232 : 4e75      rts
----------------


To profile whole bootup, profiling needs to be enabled right
from the start, and stopped (e.g. by breakpoint) at appropriate
point.

This debugger command file does profiling until first brk() syscall
(i.e. shortly after kernel starts init and that does its first alloc):
--- profile-boot.ini ---
profile on
b pc = sys_brk
------------------------

Adding that to Hatari options with "--parse profile-boot.ini",
will start profiling from the very first executed instruction.

After debugger gets invoked on first brk() syscall function call /
breakpoint, one can save profile with:
	> profile save profile.txt

Resulting file can be post-processed with:
	$ hatari_profile -st -a System.map profile.txt

To see how much emulated time the profiled part took, and to get lists
of functions taking most cycles / time, using most instructions, and
being called most.

To debug and get back traces to where "die_if_kernel" bug handler gets
called, one can use following files:
---- bt-show.ini ----
profile stack
---- bt-init.ini ----
profile on
b pc=die_if_kernel :noinit :trace :file bt-show.ini
------------------------

And start hatari with "--parse bt-init.ini" option.  Backtraces to any
other functions listed in kernel symbol file can caught the same way.

Breakpoint options:
* :file -- execute debugger commands from given file when breakpoint is hit
* :trace -- continue running without dropping to debugger
* :noinit -- no reset for profile/caller info when breakpoint is hit

(Last option is needed only for the "profile stack" command.)

What symbols are in the symbol file dictates what one sees with many
of the debugger commands.  If one does just tracing and profiling, one
can reduce symbol warnings from Hatari by removing unnecessary symbols
from the used symbols file:
	$ grep ' [tT] ' Symbols.map > code-symbols.map

If one is interested only of e.g. tracing kernel syscalls, one should
load just those to debugger:
	$ grep ' [tT] sys_' Symbols.map > syscall-symbols.map
	...
	> symbols syscall-symbols.map
	> trace cpu_symbols

(System call info is naturally interesting only after user-space
processes are running & calling them.)


If you see errors like these on Linux console:
	hda: possibly failed opcode: 0x39
	hda: possibly failed opcode: 0x30
(On Linux v5.4, IDE is on 'sda' instead of 'hda'.)

Those are IDE write command opcodes.  Make sure your IDE image
actually *is* writable and try again.


9. Debian m68k install
----------------------

9.1 Debian installer
--------------------

These are setup instructions for testing Debian installer in Hatari.
You need matching kernel, initrd and installation ISO image files for
this.

0. Work directory:
   $ mkdir -p debian/installer
   $ cd debian/installer

1. Get latest Debian installer initrd:
   $ wget https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/debian-installer/2022-03-17/m68k/debian-installer-images_2021XXXX_m68k.tar.gz
   $ tar xvf debian-installer-images*.gz
   $ cp installer-m68k/current/images/nativehd/initrd.gz ..

2. get kernel files for version matching above tar output
   (if it is still available):
   $ wget http://ftp.ports.debian.org/debian-ports/pool-m68k/main/l/linux/linux-image-5.18.0-2-m68k_5.18.5-1_m68k.deb
   $ ar x linux-image-*_m68k.deb
   $ tar xvf data.tar.xz
   $ cp -av boot/* ..

3. get kernel debug symbols (from the huge debug package):
   $ wget http://ftp.ports.debian.org/debian-ports/pool-m68k/main/l/linux/linux-image-5.18.0-2-m68k-dbg_5.18.5-1_m68k.deb
   $ tar xvf data.tar.xz --wildcards '*/System.map-*'
   $ cp -av cp -av usr/lib/debug/boot/System.map-* ..

4. Set up lilo.cfg with a framebuffer mode supported by Debian installer
   (it needs at least 16 colors to be usable):
   $ cd ..
   $ cat > lilo.cfg
[LILO]
Kernel = vmlinux-5.18.5-1-m68k
Symbols = System.map-5.18.5-1-m68k
Args = video=atafb:vga16 console=tty
Ramdisk = initrd.gz
KernelToFastRam = FALSE
RamdiskToFastRam = TRUE
^D

5. Get ISO image release matching installer & kernel (checksum files are in same directory):
   $ wget https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/snapshots/2022-03-28/debian-11.0.0-m68k-NETINST-1.iso

6. Try running Hatari with them:
    $ hatari --log-level debug \
      --fast-forward on --fastfdc on --timer-d on \
      --machine falcon --dsp none --fpu 68882 \
      --cpuclock 32 --cpu-exact off --compatible off \
      --mmu on -s 14 --ttram 128 --addr24 off \
      --monitor vga -c lilo.cfg --natfeats on \
      --ide-master debian-11.0.0-m68k-NETINST-1.iso \
      --lilo "debug=nfcon root=/dev/ram init=/init"

NOTE: Hatari does not support networking so network install obviously
wo not work.  There are not any ready made images of pre-installed and
up to date m68k Debian installs either.


9.2 Running initrd as normal disk
---------------------------------

If Debian boot has issues already in its initrd, you could try running
it as normal disk with monolithic kernel, or using modular kernel with
a working initrd.

Converting initrd to a normal EXT2 disk partition, and using
fakeroot session to retain file properties requiring root rights:
   $ mkdir initrd
   $ fakeroot /bin/bash
   # cd initrd
   # zcat ../initrd.gz | cpio -i
   # cd ..
   # /sbin/mkfs.ext2 -t ext2 -L INITRD -d initrd rootfs.img 32M
   # exit


9.3 Bootstrapping Debian installation on PC
-------------------------------------------

Doing first stage of setting up minimal m68k Debian system image
(without package PGP signing checks), as root:
   # apt install debootstrap
   # debootstrap --foreign --arch=m68k --no-check-gpg sid debian-chroot http://ftp.ports.debian.org/debian-ports/
   # cp -a /path/to/hatari/tools/linux/init.sh debian-chroot/init
   # /sbin/mkfs.ext2 -t ext2 -L DEBIAN -d debian-chroot debian.img 512M
   # chown $USER.$USER debian.img

NOTE: debootstrap needs to be done on a partition that is not mounted
with "noexec" or "nodev" option, otherwise it fails!

To finish bootstrapping, one would need to boot it on m68k system
and run "debootstrap --second-stage".

TODO: test again whether there are improvements to last status:
- Hatari:
  debootstrap fails to kernel oops
- m68k system-qemu:
  does not support required HW
- m68k user-qemu (from Debian Stretch):
  fails completely on any m68k Debian binary
- Aranym:
------------------------------------------------------------
$ cat > linux.config
# NOTE, run with: aranym-mmu -l <conffile>
[GLOBAL]
FastRAM = 64

[LILO]
Kernel = vmlinux
Args = video=atafb:vga16 console=tty debug=nfcon root=/dev/sda ro
init=/init

# 512MB EXT2 image with mkfs.ext2 (Cylinders = 2 * size in MB)
[IDE0]
Cylinders = 1024
Heads = 16
SectorsPerTrack = 64
Present = Yes
IsCDROM = No
ByteSwap = Yes
ReadOnly = Yes
Path = debian.img
ModelName = Debian-m68k
^D
$ aranym-mmu -l linux.config
------------------------------------------------------------


10. Linux kernel issues
-----------------------

10.1 Known issues
-----------------

- Linux barfs at ST-RAM memory range given after TT-RAM.  However,
  if kernel is loaded to TT-RAM and ST-RAM range is given before
  TT-RAM range, kernel crashes.  Based on mails from 2013, this
  seems to be a known Linux/Atari issue

  Workaround: Hatari lilo.c gives ST-RAM before TT-RAM in bootinfo

- Hatari debug output shows IDE and DSP reset messages on Falcon at
  2Hz (from floppy media change detection) if Linux is started with
  --lilo, instead of from TOS.  This is because TOS initializes PSG
  port-A register bits to sensible values and Linux does not.

  Workaround: kernel patch


10.2 TODO / investigate more
----------------------------

- Kernel does not recognize ACSI drives at all, although kernel
  reports finding Atari ACSI HW:
------------------------------------------------------------
Atari hardware found: STND_SHIFTER ST_MFP YM2149 MSTE_CLK ACSI
...
Please append a correct "root=" boot option; here are the available
partitions:
0200            3280 fd0
 (driver?)
0201            3280 fd1
 (driver?)
0100            4096 ram0
 (driver?)
Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
------------------------------------------------------------
  Only SCSI & IDE drives are recognized

- Kernel double bus errors right at start when 040/060 is used with
  CPU cache/prefetch enabled.  It is possible that compiling 040 (or
  060) specific kernel would help:
	http://www.linux-m68k.org/faq/afterburner.html

- Hatari v.2.3.x regression to above: With 040/060 CPU cache /
  prefetch emulation disabled, kernel dies to NULL pointer in
  mfp_timer_c_handler() when first user-space process is started:
---------------------- 040 -------------------------------

  This did not happen with 2019 v2.3-dev Git version, and Linux
  boots fine on real 060 Falcon:

11. User-space issues with cache/prefetch enabled
--------------------------------------------------

These cannot be tested any more because booting fails when
cache & prefetch are enabled, but with Hatari v2.2.1, Linux
could occasionally booted successfully with them enabled too.
