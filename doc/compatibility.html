<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Here are lists of Atari software that have been tested with
different Hatari versions and configurations.</p>

<p>First is listed software (games, demos and applications) for normal
STs, after them is listed STE software.  Then there are a few TT-only
games and demos, and finally a list of somewhat working Falcon games,
demos and applications.</p>

<p>Technical details and any known issues in the software are described
in the "Notes" column of the lists.  Software having issues has different
"Hatari version" column background color; <a class="minor">orange</a>
for minor and <a class="major">red</a> for major issues.  The first
known/tested Hatari version with which a program worked (perfectly)
or with which it was last tested still to have issues, is given in
the version field.</p>


<h3>Reporting compatibility issues</h3>

<p>If something that works on the real hardware doesn't work properly
in Hatari (or something has started working in latest Hatari version)
and this information is missing from these lists, please mail
hatari-devel mailing list so that we can update the list.</p>

<p>Before reporting something not working as expected, please
check few things:
<ul>

<li>That you have enabled the "Slower but more compatible CPU"
Hatari system option and that the machine type (ST/STe/TT/Falcon)
is correct.</li>

<li>Amount of memory. Some games and demos may not work if you have
specified too little or too much memory.  For ST, 1MB memory size
is usually fairly safe.</li>

<li>Some games/demos can refuse to run when GEMDOS HD emulation is
enabled (due to presence of Hatari cartridge image needed for that).
In STF/STE mode, it's also better to disable the MegaST's real time
clock.
</li>

<li>TOS version: ST demos and games may require a specific TOS
version and fail to work with all other versions. If you notice that
this information is missing for some listed game or demo, please send
mail to the hatari-devel mailing list.
<ul>
<li>Note that many games and demos (especially floppy based ones),
don't work with the free EmuTOS TOS. For more information, see
<a href="emutos.txt">emutos.txt</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Also note that since Hatari 1.8, support is included also for STX, IPF and CTR
floppy image formats. They allow storing disk contents in an unaltered form,
without requiring a crack to remove the copy-protection. Some complex
protections rely on precise CPU/FDC timings provided with these
formats, and a specific TOS version.</p>
<ul>
<li>For STF protected games, it is recommended to use TOS 1.02 or 1.04 and
1MB RAM, as well as turning HD emulation OFF for maximum compatibility
(but most games will run fine with different settings).</li>
</ul>

information on games compatibility on Atari forum</a>.)

<h2>ST software compatibility list</h2>

<p>These aren't comprehensive lists. <em>The lists concentrate
mainly on software that has (historically had) problems working in
Hatari or provide good regression test-cases for some specific
technical emulation issues</em>, but some well known other programs
are also listed.</p>

<p>By default <b>everything that works on a real ST should work also in Hatari</b>.

<h3>ST demos</h3>

<p>Some (very) rare demos try to install IKBD code.  Hatari doesn't have
full 6301 emulator, but has specific code to handle these particular demos.
They are marked with '*'.  Few remaining screen sync issues are related to
hi/lo frequency switching or switching to 60 Hz for too long (used
for border removal).</p>

<h3 id="Midi_setup">Midi setup</h3>

<p>If you don't have a MIDI sequencer, on Linux you can use
a softsynth like Timidity or FluidSynth instead (if your distribution
supports ALSA). For instructions, see the
<a href="midi-linux.txt">midi-linux.txt</a> file.</p>


<h2>STE software compatibility list</h2>

<p>By default everything should work with the STE emulation.  The lists
below contain nearly all the STE specific software that the developers
could get their hands on...</p>


<h3>STE games</h3>

<p>First are some STE games that do work with the STE features
in Hatari.  Most of these games work only on STE, but here are also some
games which work (or have a version that works) also on ST, i.e. they
are just STE enhanced.  These are marked with '*'.</p>

<h2>Falcon software compatibility list</h2>

<p>You can select between three different DSP emulation modes with
the Hatari "--dsp" option:
<ul>
  <li><b>none</b>: No emulation.
      If program doesn't need/use DSP, this is the best option.</li>
  <li><b>emu</b>: DSP emulation.  Needed if program requires DSP.
      On by default for Falcon. Slow.</li>
  <li><b>dummy</b>: Faked DSP response to DSP commands.
      Some rare programs that need DSP may also work with faked DSP.
      This is much faster than the real DSP emulation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The "dsp" column in tables below tells which DSP emulation mode
needs to be used for the given program to work.  If it doesn't matter,
the column contains "-". The column for whether the program works and
for whether it has (working) sound have "yes" when this is true and
otherwise "-".</p>

<p>If something works only with either WinUAE or oldUAE CPU core,
that's documented.  Many timing critical demos (for example ones using
NoCrew's DSP MP2-player) that are marked as working in the list below,
<em>work only with the (default) WinUAE CPU core</em>.</p>

<p>Due to incomplete VIDEL emulation and some remaining emulation
cycle accuracy issues, some Falcon programs don't work yet.  Most
games and demos work with RGB monitor, those requiring VGA one are
indicated separately.</p>

<h3>Falcon demos</h3>

<p>Some demos require FPU, although normal Falcon's don't have a one.
Old UAE CPU core always emulates FPU both for TT and Falcon machines.
With the (default) WinUAE CPU core you need to enable FPU separately
if demo is stated to require that.</p>

<h2>Software sites</h2>

<p>In case you're new to the Atari scene or an old-timer who's forgotten
where all the freely available software is, these file archive sites
still retain their Atari sections:</p>
<ul>

<p>Demos (for many platforms) can be found from pouet.net and
besides Atari scene news, Dead Hackers Society provides descriptions,

Atari:
