<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Here are lists of Atari software that have been tested with
different Hatari versions and configurations.</p>

<p>First is listed software (games, demos and applications) for normal
STs, after them is listed STE software.  Then there are a few TT-only
games and demos, and finally a list of somewhat working Falcon games,
demos and applications.</p>

<p>Technical details and any known issues in the software are described
in the "Notes" column of the lists.  Software having issues has different
"Hatari version" column background color; <a class="minor">orange</a>
for minor and <a class="major">red</a> for major issues.  The first
known/tested Hatari version with which a program worked (perfectly)
or with which it was last tested still to have issues, is given in
the version field.</p>


<h3>Reporting compatibility issues</h3>

<p>If something that works on the real hardware doesn't work properly
in Hatari (or something has started working in latest Hatari version)
and this information is missing from these lists, please mail
hatari-devel mailing list so that we can update the list.</p>

<p>Before reporting something not working as expected, please
check few things:
<ul>

<li>That you have enabled the "Slower but more compatible CPU"
Hatari system option and that the machine type (ST/STe/TT/Falcon)
is correct.</li>

<li>Amount of memory. Some games and demos may not work if you have
specified too little or too much memory.  For ST, 1MB memory size
is usually fairly safe.</li>

<li>Some games/demos can refuse to run when GEMDOS HD emulation is
enabled (due to presence of Hatari cartridge image needed for that).
In STF/STE mode, it is also better to disable the MegaST's real time
clock.
</li>

<li>TOS version: ST demos and games may require a specific TOS
version and fail to work with all other versions. If you notice that
this information is missing for some listed game or demo, please send
mail to the hatari-devel mailing list.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Note that some demos and games (especially floppy-only ones done with
STOS), don't work with the free EmuTOS ROM.  To make sure they have
enough RAM available, you should use the most appropriate EmuTOS
version: 192K one for ST, 256K one for STE, and 512K one (included
with the Hatari binary downloads as it has widest HW support) for
TT/Falcon games and demos. For more information, see
<a href="emutos.txt">emutos.txt</a>.
</p>

<p>
Also note that since Hatari 1.8, support is included also for STX, IPF and CTR
floppy image formats. They allow storing disk contents in an unaltered form,
without requiring a crack to remove the copy-protection. Some complex
protections rely on precise CPU/FDC timings provided with these
formats, and a specific TOS version.</p>
<ul>
<li>For STF protected games, it is recommended to use TOS 1.02 or 1.04 and
1MB RAM, as well as turning HD emulation OFF for maximum compatibility
(but most games will run fine with different settings).</li>
</ul>

<h2>ST software compatibility list</h2>

<p>These aren't comprehensive lists. <em>The lists concentrate
mainly on software that has (historically had) problems working in
Hatari or provide good regression test-cases for some specific
technical emulation issues</em>, but some well known other programs
are also listed.</p>

<p>By default <b>everything that works on a real ST should work also in Hatari</b>.

<h3>ST demos</h3>

<p>Some (very) rare demos try to install IKBD code.  Hatari doesn't have
full 6301 emulator, but has specific code to handle these particular demos.
They are marked with '*'.  Few remaining screen sync issues are related to
hi/lo frequency switching or switching to 60 Hz for too long (used
for border removal).</p>

<h3 id="Midi_setup">Midi setup</h3>

<p>If you don't have a MIDI sequencer, on Linux you can use
a softsynth like Timidity or FluidSynth instead (if your distribution
supports ALSA). For instructions, see the
<a href="midi-linux.txt">midi-linux.txt</a> file.</p>


<h2>STE software compatibility list</h2>

<p>By default everything should work with the STE emulation.  The lists
below contain nearly all the STE specific software that the developers
could get their hands on...</p>


<h3>STE games</h3>

<p>First are some STE games that do work with the STE features
in Hatari.  Most of these games work only on STE, but here are also some
games which work (or have a version that works) also on ST, i.e. they
are just STE enhanced.  These are marked with '*' (for more info, see
<a href="http://atari.8bitchip.info/steandg.html">here</a>).</p>

<p>Most programs that work on TT work also in the Falcon emulation.
As all 1-8 bit GEM programs work without problems under TT emulation
this section lists only programs that have TT-specific features.</p>

<h2>Falcon software compatibility list</h2>

<p>You can select between three different DSP emulation modes with
the Hatari "--dsp" option:
<ul>
  <li><b>none</b>: No emulation.
      If program doesn't need/use DSP, this is the best option.</li>
  <li><b>emu</b>: DSP emulation.  Needed if program requires DSP.
      On by default for Falcon. Slow.</li>
  <li><b>dummy</b>: Faked DSP response to DSP commands.
      Some rare programs that need DSP may also work with faked DSP.
      This is much faster than the real DSP emulation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The "dsp" column in tables below tells which DSP emulation mode
needs to be used for the given program to work.  If it doesn't matter,
the column contains "-". The column for whether the program works and
for whether it has (working) sound have "yes" when this is true and
otherwise "-".</p>

<p>If program requires FPU or MMU to be enabled, or does not work with
MMU, that is indicated in the program description.</p>

<p>Due to incomplete VIDEL emulation and some
remaining emulation cycle accuracy issues, some Falcon programs aren't
usable yet.  Most games and demos work with RGB monitor, those requiring
VGA one are indicated separately.</p>

You need to enable (68882) FPU separately if demo is stated to require
FPU.</p>

<h3>060 Falcon games and demos</h3>

<p>
Here are Falcon programs documented to be for a 060 CPU.  Issue with
several of them is them relying on CT TOS and its emulation for the
030/040 CPU/FPU instructions missing in 060.  Some of the programs may
even have worked with the oldUAE CPU core included to earlier Hatari
versions, because it did not limit its instruction emulation only to
instructions available on the actual selected CPU and FPU HW type.
</p>
<p>
FPSP060 is standalone Atari program providing emulation of the
instructions missing on 060.  Just have it in AUTO folder for demos
listed as requiring it.  See:
<a href="https://github.com/th-otto/fpsp">Thorsten Otto's FPSP
repository</a>.

<h2>Software sites</h2>

<p>In case you are new to the Atari scene or an old-timer who's forgotten
where all the freely available software is, these file archive sites
still retain their Atari sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ftp.funet.fi/pub/atari/">funet.fi</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www-ftp.lip6.fr/pub/atari/">lip6.fr</a></li>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de/pub/atari/">tu-berlin.de</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.umich.edu/~archive/atari/">umich.edu</a></li>
<li><a href="http://no-fragments.atari.org/no_fragments_04/archive/">no-fragments</a> (Falcon SW)</li>
</ul>

<p>Demos (for many platforms) can be found from pouet.net and
besides Atari scene news, Dead Hackers Society provides descriptions,
screenshots and files for tools to create music, graphics and code on
Atari:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pouet.net/">pout.net</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dhs.nu/files.php">dhs.nu</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are also couple of sites dedicated to STE and Falcon specific
software:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://christophe.bray.free.fr/informatique/falcon/falcon_jeux.htm">Cristophe's Falcon games site</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191114091722/http://atari-ste.anvil-soft.com:80/html/archivapps.htm">Information about programs with STE specific features</a></li>
