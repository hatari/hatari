Hatari and EmuTOS
=================

To run the emulator, a TOS ROM image is needed.  EmuTOS, a free
implementation of TOS, is shipped with the official binary releases
of Hatari.

This tos.img ROM image is identical to the official binary package of
EmuTOS, which is available at the SourceForge website of EmuTOS.  For
downloading other versions or the source code of EmuTOS, please visit
the EmuTOS website.

The tos.img file included with the latest Hatari releases is
the etos1024k.img[1] from a preceding EmuTOS release:
- Hatari v2.5.0:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/1.3/

The tos.img file included with earlier Hatari releases is
the etos512k.img[1] from a preceding EmuTOS release:
- Hatari v2.4.0, v2.4.1:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/1.1.1/

[1] This is the "all languages" version, intended mainly for TT & Falcon:

    While 192k and 256k EmuTOS variants work better for ST and STE
    programs in some cases, only the larger image variants contain
    support for all the hardware.  Older 512k EmuTOS variants support
    also all the EmuTOS languages, but nowadays only the new EmuTOS
    1024k variant does (has space for all of them).

Notes for older EmuTOS versions:

* EmuTOS <= v0.9.6:

  EmuTOS changed its INF file format in v0.9.7.  Hatari's Atari
  program autostarting and TOS resolution setting functionality
  supports only EmuTOS >= v0.9.7 INF file format

* EmuTOS <= v0.8.5 with Hatari <= v2.0:

  In order to work with Hatari, EmuTOS v0.8.5 and earlier require
  the FastBoot option to be enabled. This is used to skip some memory
  tests (that Hatari v2.0 and earlier do not support) when EmuTOS
  tries to determine the available RAM size.


What is EmuTOS
==============

EmuTOS is a single-user single-tasking operating system for the 32-bit
Atari computers and emulators.  It can be used as a replacement for
the TOS images needed for using the emulators, and its latest versions
support also wide variety of real hardware.  All the source code is
open and free, licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
A copy of the GNU GPL can be found in the gpl.txt file.

EmuTOS project has home page at SourceForge:
	https://emutos.sourceforge.io/
With sources at GitHub:
	https://github.com/emutos/emutos


EmuTOS usage
============

There are various reasons for using EmuTOS instead of the original
TOS ROM images:

* Legal.  Users who don't have Atari HW or other legal means to obtain
  the original Atari TOS ROMs (for all of the Hatari supported Atari
  versions: ST/STE/TT/Falcon), but would like to try out Hatari and
  see what kind of software the Atari machines had.  EmuTOS gives
  them a legal way to test Hatari with free demos, games etc.

* Performance.  EmuTOS boots faster to desktop than Atari TOS versions.

* Convenience.  EmuTOS does not need a HD driver to access hard disk
  images, and same 1024k (or 512k) image supports all the hardware that
  different Atari TOS versions support.

* Continuity.  Users who want to continue using Atari compatible
  operating systems and need an open source replacement of TOS for
  modifications. Beside EmuTOS, they typically also use FreeMiNT,
  XaAES and fVDI as operating system replacements/improvements.

  This includes users of Atari FPGA clones, such as MiST & MiSTer:
	https://github.com/mist-devel/mist-board/wiki
	https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki
  users of new "Atari" machines, like Atari ColdFire Project:
	http://acp.atari.org/
  and even Amiga (WinUAE) emulator and real Amiga hardware.


EmuTOS compatibility notes
==========================

These comments apply to EmuTOS v1.x.

Many commercial games (e.g. Bombjack, Nebulus, Oids, Super Hang-On,
Turrican, Xenon...) and almost all ST/STe/TT applications work fine
with EmuTOS.

Because (even 192k variant of) EmuTOS uses a bit more memory than
normal TOS, badly written (typically floppy-only) games & demos may
blindly overwrite EmuTOS memory. They also often rely on (undocumented)
TOS internal variables & functions being at specific memory locations,
and will crash when they call these bogus addresses, use bogus values,
or call OS functions which internal state they had overwritten with
garbage. For example (older) Omikron Basic and many programs done with
it have this problem.

As a special case of this problem, input (e.g. joystick) does not work
in unpatched STOS Basic games as they access it through other means
than XBIOS function Kbdvbase() or by hooking into the IKBD interrupt
vector. They use unofficial system variables which location depends on
the TOS version.

However, ST/STE games that work from HD and/or have been fixed to work
with newer TOS versions, should usually be fine.

Support for Falcon 16-bit resolution is still missing from EmuTOS v1.3
AES/VDI, and Falcon DSP support was added only after EmuTOS v1.0
release.

Additionally, very old EmuTOS versions (up to v0.9.1) lacked support
for the (deprecated) line-A graphics functions which are used in many
free/shareware games (ones done with GFA basic etc).  This isn't an
issue with newer EmuTOS versions.

Lists of known issues and incompatible applications are listed in
incompatible.txt file coming with EmuTOS:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emutos/emutos/master/doc/incompatible.txt


Debugging issues with EmuTOS
============================

EmuTOS debug symbols
--------------------

After loading EmuTOS debug symbols from the file coming with the 1024k
(or 512k) EmuTOS image, using debugger "symbols etos1024k.sym" command,
you can ask debugger to "trace cpu_symbols", to get trace of all the
(non-static) function calls EmuTOS does.

For smaller EmuTOS variants, there's a script[1] you can use to convert
the emutos2.map file (produced during EmuTOS build) to a format you
can load to Hatari debugger with its "symbols" command[2].

[1] http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29381777
[2] https://hatari.tuxfamily.org/doc/debugger.html#Debug_symbols

After loading the symbols to the Hatari debugger, disassembling the
problematic address should provide more clues for the problem.  Or you
can just look up the program counter value given in the EmuTOS panic
message from the map file.


EmuTOS debug output
-------------------

Start Hatari with "--natfeats on --trace os_base" options to get
EmuTOS debug output (with 512k or 1024k images), and to redirect
EmuTOS panic output and other console messages to Hatari's console.

For extra debug output and to add your own debug statements, you
need to uncomment following line from suitable EmuTOS source file(s):
	#define ENABLE_KDEBUG 1

And recompile EmuTOS image. Note that you can't do that for whole
EmuTOS as resulting image would be too large.


Other EmuTOS debug output options
---------------------------------

There are debug output options for different HW in EmuTOS "config.h"
header file, but they aren't necessary with NatFeats and console
output redirection.

If you want to test them anyway, below is listed each of them with
Hatari command line options to save their output (to "debug.txt"), and
shortcomings of each option are following:

* MIDI_DEBUG_PRINT: "--midi-in /dev/null --midi-out debug.txt"
  - Hatari needs to be compiled with PortMidi support disabled,
    as PortMidi interprets only real MIDI events

* RS232_DEBUG_PRINT: "--rs232-in /dev/null --rs232-out debug.txt"

* SCC_DEBUG_PRINT: "--scc-b-out debug.txt"
  - SCC port is available only on MegaSTE/TT/Falcon


Notes:

* Don't use Hatari stdout/stder ("/dev/stdout", "/dev/stderr") as
  debug output files, unless you absolutely need to get ordering right
  between the extra debug messages and other output, as that results
  in messed up console and output from Hatari

* Both input & output files need to be specified for RS232 & MIDI,
  otherwise Hatari does not enable them


Debugging OS calls, Line-A usage and panics
-------------------------------------------

Ask Hatari debugger to stop when the program is started:
-----------
> b pc=TEXT
CPU condition breakpoint 1 with 1 condition(s) added:
pc = TEXT
> c
Returning to emulation...
-----------
(In above example '>' indicates what you type to debugger.)

Then when the debugger is invoked at program startup, you can ask it to:
- collect CPU instruction history
- break on exceptions that trigger the panic
- load symbols + profile what happens, as these will
  provide EmuTOS callstack when debugger is entered
- trace all OS calls and line-A opcodes leading to the panic
with:
-----------
> history on
> setopt -D
> symbols etos1024k.sym
> profile on
> trace os_all
> b LineAOpcode ! LineAOpcode && lineAopcode ! 0xffff :trace
> c
Returning to emulation...
-----------

With above, when the exception causing the panic triggers the debugger,
you see EmuTOS callstack and the OS calls & line-A opcodes leading to it,
and have a panic message on console from which you can copy & paste
relevant parts.

You can then ask what the register values are at that point and what
are the CPU instructions leading to it with the "r" and "history"
commands. Memory state and addresses accessed by the instructions can
be inspected with the "m" command.

For more info on Hatari debugger usage, see the Hatari manual section
on it: https://hatari.tuxfamily.org/doc/debugger.html


Debugging freezes
-----------------

Hatari profiling support can be used to debug OS freezes.  If EmuTOS
gets stuck, just profile it for a while and then ask debugger for a
profile that tells where it's looping.  Then disassemble that part
with EmuTOS symbols directly in Hatari.


EmuTOS free/shareware compatibility lists
=========================================

The compatibility lists below cater mainly for users who don't have
Atari HW and therefore won't have (legal) version of commercial Atari
software and most likely lack motivation to investigate applications
very deeply (Linux offers better alternatives nowadays for most of
that). I.e. the lists skip (most) commercial software and concentrate
on EmuTOS compatibility of freely available games and demos (including
commercial games that have been released later on for free
distribution).

Games that are considered good quality & fun, are marked with "*".
All the listed demos are quite OK.

Most demos can be downloaded from:
	http://pouet.net/
	http://demozoo.org/

Many of the other programs can be found from Atari Mania:
	http://www.atarimania.com/atari-st-tt-falcon.html

And the remaining Atari FTP sites.

Below are first listed ST demos, games, graphics & MIDI applications,
then STE demos, games and music applications, then TT programs and
last Falcon demos, games and applications.


Working Atari ST demos and games
--------------------------------

For STs, 192k EmuTOS variant is best as it leaves most RAM free.

If ST has more memory, *and* OS speed is important (i.e. app uses OS
drawing functions), 512k (or 1024k) variant could be used instead, as
that is compiled with higher optimizations than 192k one.

Some old, floppy only games expect certain memory areas occupied by
EmuTOS, to be over-writable without issues.  These need 192k image.
Some of them can be gotten to work by using EmuTOS cartridge image
(it uses less memory than normal EmuTOS), like this:
	hatari --tos etos192uk.img --cartridge etoscart.img floppy.img

Mostly the non-working games "Panic" EmuTOS during their startup,
but it can happen also later on.

Broken Atari ST demos and games
-------------------------------

Below are listed demos and games known not to work with EmuTOS. EmuTOS
documents issues with a subset of them in more detail in:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emutos/emutos/master/doc/incompatible.txt


Broken (floppy) demo classics
.............................

- Amiga demo (by Exceptions)
  - bus errors before *any* OS calls
- B.I.G demo (by Exceptions)
  - bus errors before *any* OS calls
- Froggies over the Fence (by Legacy, ST Connexion, Overlanders)

    Rwabs(0,0x30000,8,1,0)
  - with high-RAM etos512k, complains about 1/2 MB RAM
- Place to be (by EKO)

  - Floprd(0x7000, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1)


ST games with broken input handling
...................................

As expected, STOS games which use STOS routines for input do not work
as STOS does that in TOS binary version specific manner (see EmuTOS
incompatible.txt).

Floppy-only (color) STOS games:
- Diamond Ice       (joystick input doesn't work)
- Islandstrike      (mouse input doesn't work)
- Ozone             (fire at start doesn't work)
- Vidigrid v2       (mouse input doesn't work)

Note that their AUTO-folder starter programs need to be moved to
floppy root and started from there, see EmuTOS incompatible.txt.

GEMDOS HD supporting (color) STOS games:
- Balls Up          (mouse input doesn't work)
- Color Clash*      (fire at start doesn't work)
- Dice II           (mouse doesn't work)
- Heartland         (fire at start doesn't work)
- Mr Dice*          (gets spurious joy input)
- Nostram           (input doesn't work)
- Orbit             (mouse input doesn't work)
- Phantom           (joystick input doesn't work)
- Pipetris          (spurious joystick left input)
- Prehistorik3 demo (spurious joystick left input)
- Reflection*       (keys work, mouse doesn't)
- Roadkill 2        (joystick input doesn't work)
- Skatetribe        (fire at start doesn't work)
- Smash hit         (input doesn't work)
- Sudoku Universe*  (mouse input doesn't work)
- The Rollercoaster Experience (fire at start doesn't work)
- Trackball         (mouse doesn't work)

Even some commercial games use TOS version specific input handling
(see EmuTOS incompatible.txt):
- Brain Blasters / The Teller demo  (input doesn't work)
- Super Cauldron demo  (fire doesn't start game)
- Striker soccer demo  (fire doesn't start game)

Free/shareware color games (more input issues):
- Douglas Rockmoor  (see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)
- Space invaders    (see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)

Mono games (more input issues):
- Crystal Cave*     (line-A bitblit & draw/clear sprite, see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)
- Macro War         (line-A bitblit, see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)
- Ramses*           (panic, see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)

GEM games (more input issues):
- Anduril           (see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)
- Invaders*         (see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)

- ST versions of Hypnosis / Quaderno (see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)

MIDI programs are available from Tim's MIDI world:
	http://tamw.atari-users.net/

Most of the non-GEM ST tracker & chip music composer programs work
also with EmuTOS, most even with the 512k/1024k EmuTOS variants.
See STE notes for more info on them.


Atari STE programs
------------------

There are not that many STE specific (or even STE enhanced) programs
(see the "STE software compatibility list" section in compatibility.html),
so this tries to cover status for all the games, and many of the demos.

Note: STE emulation needs 256k variant of EmuTOS.  With US i.e. 60Hz
image (etos256us.img), you may get screen flicker and music playback
issues with demos and games.  Full STE support requires EmuTOS
v0.9.4+.

- Cameleon (see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)
- Hero (STOS, see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)
- Protracker v2 STE, Equinox version (see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)
  - http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=13381


Atari TT programs
-----------------

TT emulation requires 512k (or 1024k) variant of EmuTOS (the one
shipped with Hatari).  TT-low (256-color) mode and sound support
requires EmuTOS v0.9.6+.

(If program supports features common to both TT and Falcon, but
has no specific Falcon support, it's listed for TT.)

Working applications:
- Calamus SL demo (1991 demo version)
- Calamus SL/L/LE 20xx lite versions
  - Need either GDOS or older EmuTOS v0.9.5 - v0.9.12
- Mandelbrot playtime (fracplay, uses FPU)
- M_PLAYER v4.02
  - https://gtello.pagesperso-orange.fr/mplayere.htm
- PixArt4
  - http://www.1632systems.co.uk/www/html/Product/pixart.htm
- Vision v4.9 (works also in ST, but is much nicer in TT low/med)
  - http://jlusetti.free.fr/visione.htm
- ZXR v0.1m (ZX Spectrum emulator for 020+ machines)
  - https://www.atari-forum.com/viewtopic.php?t=34048

Working demos:
- 256mbrot, Bragg, Glasstro, Orion-B, Yabt (TT/Falcon intros by ray//.tSCc)
- 4getful (by gwEm, 4KB intro TT-version)
- Adebug 3DTT demo (by Brainstorm)
- Cube 256 (030 ST-low 256b intro by Thadoss / Dune)
- CrY image viewer (by .tSCc)
- Elegant Machinery (by Evolution)
- Led Blur (by Miro)
  - Much faster on Falcon/16-bit
- Mandelbrot explorer (by .tSCc)
- Monscape (by Escape)
- TC fish (by .tSCc)
- TT highres slideshow (by .tSCc)
- Shiny Bubbles TT (by Xanth FX)
- Spear of Destiny (port by Gildor)
- XiTEC demos (by Omega)
  - On exiting Swing, EmuTOS panics with privilege violation
    (TOS bombs and continues)
- Yeti3D (port by Gildor)

Working games:
- Capy (by YesCREW)
- DGEM v0.16 (Dungeon Master GEM version)
  - Start from TT-med (or use 640x400@16 VDI mode on ST/e)
- GEM Breakout
- GEM Klikomania
- GEM Landmine
- GEM Magnetic v0.8 (Magnetic Scrolls game runner)
  - Crashes on resolutions smaller than game window. Setup game colors
    to black and white, disable graphics and use TT mono monitor
    (or use 672x672@1 VDI mode on ST/e)
- GEM Manga Puzzle (needs 256 color mode)
- GEM Milanopoly
- GEM NetHack v3.4.3
- GEM Santarun
- GEM Slashem v3.3.1
- OpenDUNE
- OpenTTD (start from TT-low with 256MBs of TT-RAM)
- Oxyd (Falcon version)
- PM Doom, Heretic & Hexen v0.55 (ports by Patrice Mandin)
- ScummVM 2.8 (lite build by Miro)
 - Official upstream version (35 engines, 280+ game variants recognized)
- The Ultimate Minesweeper (GEM)

Most of above GEM games run even on ST, but only TT (and Falcon) have
large enough resolution with enough colors for them to be properly
playable.


Falcon programs
---------------

Falcon emulation requires 512k (or 1024k) variant of EmuTOS (the one
shipped with Hatari).  Programs using DSP require EmuTOS v1.1.1+,
programs using TrueColor (TC) mode, require EmuTOS v1.3+.

Following Falcon only demos, games and apps work (mostly) fine though.

Games working with extra hacks:
- Bugger, Bunion, SkyFall, Sworm games by Resorvoir Gods:
  - use an undocumented TOS4 vector for keyboard input instead of accessing
    kbdvec correctly which use causes EmuTOS to panic.  This can be worked
    around with the following hack.prg:
    http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=26841274
  - with EmuTOS <=1.0, enabling DSP freezes the games right at startup
    (with normal TOS4, DSP is used for background music)

Partly working games:
- Bomb Squad
  - Game is 4x slower than with TOS4 (see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)
- Color Runner
  - Game cannot be started from main menu (same as with TOS v4)
