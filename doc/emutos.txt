Hatari and EmuTOS
=================

To run the emulator, a TOS ROM image is needed.  EmuTOS, a free
implementation of TOS, is shipped with the official releases of
Hatari.

This tos.img ROM image is identical to the official binary package of
EmuTOS, which is available at the SourceForge website of EmuTOS.  For
downloading other versions or the source code of EmuTOS, please visit
the EmuTOS website.

The tos.img file included with the latest Hatari releases is
the etos512k.img[1] from a preceding EmuTOS release:
- Hatari v1.9.0:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.9.4/
- Hatari v1.8.0:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.9.3/
- Hatari v1.7.0:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.9.0/
- Hatari v1.6.2:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.8.7/
- Hatari v1.6.0:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.8.6/
- Hatari v1.4.0, v1.5.0:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.8.5/
- Hatari v1.1.0, v1.2.0, v1.3.0, v1.3.1:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.8.4/
- Hatari v1.0.0, v1.0.1:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.8.3/
- Hatari v0.95:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.8.2/

Earlier Hatari binary releases have included one of the smaller
EmuTOS image files.

[1] the "all languages" version intended mainly for TT & Falcon.
    While the 192k and 256k version on some cases work better
    for ST and STE programs, only the 512k image contains
    support for all the hardware and languages.

Note for EmuTOS before 0.8.6:
  In order to work with Hatari, EmuTOS 0.8.5 and earlier require
  the FastBoot option to be enabled. This is used to skip some memory
  tests (that Hatari doesn't support yet) when EmuTOS tries to
  determine the available RAM size.


What is EmuTOS
==============

EmuTOS is a single-user single-tasking operating system for the 32-bit
Atari computers and emulators.  It can be used as a replacement for
the TOS images typically needed today for using the emulators and it is
also running on some real hardware, like the Atari Mega STE and Atari
ColdFire.  All the source code is open and free, licensed under the
GNU General Public License (GPL).  A copy of the GNU GPL can be found
in the gpl.txt file.

EmuTOS has its home at SourceForge:
       http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos


EmuTOS usage
============

There are various reasons for using EmuTOS instead of the original
TOS ROM images:

* Users who don't have Atari HW or other legal means to obtain the
  original Atari TOS ROMs (for all of the Hatari supported Atari
  versions: ST/STE/TT/Falcon), but would like to try out Hatari and
  see what kind of software the Atari machines had.  EmuTOS gives
  them a legal way to test Hatari with free demos, games etc.

* Users who want to continue using Atari compatible operating systems
  and need an open source replacement of TOS for modifications. Beside
  EmuTOS they typically also use FreeMiNT, XaAES and fVDI as operating
  system replacements/improvements.

* This includes users of Atari FPGA clones, such as MiST:
	http://code.google.com/p/mist-board/
  and users of new "Atari" machines, like Atari ColdFire Project:
	http://acp.atari.org/

* EmuTOS also allows using ACSI disk images with Hatari TT/Falcon
  emulation, whereas TOS 3 & 4 support only IDE and SCSI disks.
  Hard disk images are needed mainly for running MiNT.


EmuTOS compatibility notes
==========================

These comments apply to EmuTOS v0.9.x.

Many commercial games (e.g. Bombjack, Nebulus, Oids, Super Hang-On,
Turrican, Xenon...) and almost all ST/STe/TT applications work fine
with EmuTOS.

However, EmuTOS AES isn't yet completely compatible with normal TOS
versions (see EmuTOS bugs.txt) and VDI & line-A support is slowish.
Anybody wanting better AES/VDI support should install replacement for
these, either the free XaAES + fVDI, or commercial solutions like NVDI
(v2.5 doesn't work with EmuTOS, newer NVDI versions do).

Because (even 192k version of) EmuTOS uses more memory than normal
TOS, badly written (typically floppy-only) games may blindly overwrite
EmuTOS memory and it will then crash when the program calls an OS
function depending on overwritten values.  ST/STE games that work from
HD and/or with newer TOS versions, should be fine.

Input (e.g. joystick) doesn't work in original (STOS) games that
access it through other means than XBIOS function Kbdvbase() or by
hooking into the IKBD interrupt vector.  They use unofficial system
variables which location depends on the TOS version.  Try fixed
version of STOS games.

Support for some TT HW features and for large part of additional
Falcon features is missing.

Additionally, older EmuTOS versions (up to v0.9.1) lacked support for
the (deprecated) line-A graphics functions which are used in many
free/shareware games (ones done with GFA basic etc).  This isn't an
issue with new EmuTOS versions.


Debugging issues with EmuTOS
============================

EmuTOS debug output and debug symbols
-------------------------------------

To get extra debug output from EmuTOS, or to add your own debug
statements, you need to recompile it from the source, after enabling
the MIDI debug output in its config.h header file. Then start Hatari
with the "--midi-out /dev/stderr" option and you will see EmuTOS debug
output on Hatari's standard error (such as calls to missing Falcon
XBios functions).

Some debug output can be gotten also from the pre-built 512k
EmuTOS images by using Hatari "--natfeats on" option.

By loading the etos512k.sym EmuTOS debug symbols file coming with the
512k EmuTOS image, you can also ask debugger to "trace cpu_symbols",
to get trace of all the function calls EmuTOS does.

For smaller EmuTOS versions, there's a script[1] you can use to convert
the emutos2.map file (produced during EmuTOS build) to a format you
can load to Hatari debugger with its "symbols" command[2].

[1] http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29381777
[2] http://hg.tuxfamily.org/mercurialroot/hatari/hatari/raw-file/tip/doc/manual.html#Debug_symbols

If you've compiled EmuTOS with AHCC[3] instead of GCC, you can get
suitable symbols with AHCC "-n" linker flag, or you can use a script
coming with Hatari (ahcc-symbols-convert.sh) to convert AHCC *.map
file to a format supported by the Hatari debugger.

[3] AHCC: http://members.chello.nl/h.robbers/

After loading the symbols to the Hatari debugger, disassembling the
problematic address should provide more clues for the problem.  Or you
can just look up the program counter value given in the EmuTOS panic
message from the map file.


Debugging OS calls, Line-A usage and panics
-------------------------------------------

When debugging EmuTOS panics, the best option is to start Hatari with
"--natfeats on --trace os_base" (to get extra debug output and redirect
EmuTOS panic etc messages to console) and then ask Hatari debugger to
stop when the program is started:
-----------
> b pc=TEXT
CPU condition breakpoint 1 with 1 condition(s) added:
pc = TEXT
> c
Returning to emulation...
-----------
(In above example '>' indicates what you type to debugger.)

Then when the debugger is invoked at program startup, you can ask it to:
- collect CPU instruction history,
- break on exceptions that trigger the panic,
- load symbols and profile what happens as this will
  provide EmuTOS callstack when debugger is entered, and
- trace all OS calls and line-A opcodes leading to the panic
with:
-----------
> history on
> setopt -D
Exception debugging enabled.
> symbols etos512k.sym
> profile on
> trace os_all
> b LineAOpcode ! LineAOpcode :trace
CPU condition breakpoint 2 with 1 condition(s) added:
LineAOpcode ! LineAOpcode
-> Track value changes, show value(s) when matched.
-> Trace instead of breaking, but show still hits.
> c
Returning to emulation...
-----------

With above, when the exception causing the panic triggers the debugger,
you see EmuTOS callstack and the OS calls & line-A opcodes leading to it,
and have a panic message on console from which you can copy & paste
relevant parts.

You can then ask what the register values are at that point and what
are the CPU instructions leading to it with the "r" and "history"
commands. Memory state and addresses accessed by the instructions can
be inspected with the "m" command.

For more info on Hatari debugger usage, see the Hatari manual section
on it:
http://hg.tuxfamily.org/mercurialroot/hatari/hatari/raw-file/tip/doc/manual.html#The_debugger


Debugging freezes
-----------------

Hatari profiling support can be used to debug OS freezes.  If EmuTOS
gets stuck, just profile it for a while and then ask debugger for a
profile that tells where it's looping.  Then disassemble that part
with EmuTOS symbols directly in Hatari.


EmuTOS free/shareware compatibility lists
=========================================

The compatibility lists below cater mainly for users who don't have
Atari HW and therefore won't have (legal) version of commercial Atari
software and most likely lack motivation to investigate applications
very deeply (Linux offers better alternatives nowadays for most of
that). I.e. the lists skip commercial software and concentrate on
EmuTOS compatibility of freely available games and demos (including
commercial games that have been released later on for free
distribution).

Games that are considered good quality & fun, are marked with "*".
All the listed demos are quite OK. Most demos can be downloaded from:
	http://pouet.net/

First are listed ST demos, games, graphics & MIDI applications,
then STE demos, games and music applications, then TT programs
and last Falcon demos, games and applications.


Working Atari ST demos and games
--------------------------------

Floppy-only games and programs using Line-A need EmuTOS v0.9.3 or
newer.  For best compatibility with ST emulation, one should use 192kB
or 256kB version of EmuTOS.

Some old, floppy only games expect certain memory areas occupied by
EmuTOS, to be over-writable without issues.  Some of them may (by
blind luck) work with 512k EmuTOS or can be gotten to work by using
EmuTOS cartridge image (as it uses less memory than normal EmuTOS),
like this:
	hatari --tos etos192uk.img --cartridge etoscart.img floppy.img

Mostly the non-working games "Panic" EmuTOS during their startup,
but it can happen also later on.

Non-working color/mono/GEM Atari ST games
-----------------------------------------

These are all games that work with normal TOS from Hatari GEMDOS HD
emulated drive, i.e. aren't hardcoded to run from a floppy.  Floppy
only games aren't listed as main reason for them not working is larger
memory usage of EmuTOS (which is too awkward to debug).

Non-working color STOS games (as expected):

Working Atari STE programs
--------------------------

There are not that many STE specific (or even STE enhanced) programs:
    http://atari-ste.anvil-soft.com/html/archivapps.htm

But following STE specific & enhanced demos, games and apps work
fine with EmuTOS.

Note: STE emulation needs 256kB version of EmuTOS.  If you use 60Hz
EmuTOS version (etos256us.img), you may get screen flicker and music
playback issues with demos and games.

Demos:
- 1st Step (by Tobe/MJJ Prod)
- 32768 colors showdown (by Tronic of Effect)

EmuTOS version.


Non-working Atari STE programs
------------------------------

Partially working STE demos:
- 20 years megademo (by Atari scene collective)
  - issues in some screens
- 20 years Atari STE megademo (by Paradox)
  - some screen don't work
- Ecstasy part A (by Inner Circuit Explorers)
  - stops in middle, after 3D flight part

Atari TT programs
-----------------

TT emulation requires 512kB version of EmuTOS (the one shipped with
Hatari).  TT-low (256-color) mode support requires Jan 2016 or newer
version of EmuTOS.

Working applications:
- Mandelbrot playtime (fracplay, uses FPU)

Working demos:
- 256mbrot, Bragg, Glasstro, Orion-B, Yabt (TT/Falcon intros by ray//.tSCc)
- 4getful (by gwEm, 4KB intro TT-version)
  - Has way too low volume
- Adebug 3DTT demo (by Brainstorm)
- CrY image viewer (by .tSCc)
- Mandelbrot explorer (by .tSCc)
- TC fish (by .tSCc)
- TT highres slideshow (by .tSCc)
- Shiny Bubbles TT (by Xanth FX)
- XiTEC demos (by Omega)
  - On exiting Swing EmuTOS panics with privilege violation
    (TOS bombs and continues)

Working games:
- Capy (by YesCREW)
- GEM NetHack v3.4.3
- GEM Slashem v3.3.1
- Oxyd (Falcon version)

Broken programs:
- PixArt4
  - Drawing needs 2016 EmuTOS version (evnt_multi() fixes)
  - Crashes on startup if TT-RAM is present (unlike with TOS v3)
  - http://www.1632systems.co.uk/www/html/Product/pixart.htm
- OpenTTD:
  - Needs hundreds of MBs of TT-RAM
  - Needs to be started from TT-low resolution
 (- works also on Falcon with FPU, DSP can be disabled for speed)


Falcon programs
---------------

Falcon emulation requires 512kB version of EmuTOS
(the one shipped with Hatari).

Latest EmuTOS missing:
- HiColor support
- XBios functions for DSP

probably explains partly why graphics in many of the demos & games
look broken, their sound or music doesn't work, or why they freeze at
startup.

Following Falcon only demos, games and apps work (mostly) fine though.

- Beams (by .tscc):
  panic with bus error:
  M68000 Bus Error reading at address $3b4.
- Tere Ra'I (by Cerebral Vortex / Dune / Sector One)
- Unexpected Fun (by Orion_)
  - these exit as Dsp_Lock() fails


Falcon games
............

Games regressed in EmuTOS v0.8.x (not working anymore):
- Columns by Deadheart* (demo)
  -  colors/graphics are wrong
    (in v0.8.7 screen was just black with music on background)
- Rave*
  - colors/graphics are wrong
    (in v0.8.6, only at actual game lower half)
- SBM v0.8 (Bomberman clone)*
  - Bus error wget at 00400000

Games working in EmuTOS >=v0.9.0:
- Aces High (preview)
- BeGEMeD* (Falcon version)
- Blum
- Cavemania (demo version)
- Corsair
- DB 4K
- Double Bobble 2000* (by Reservoir Gods), disable DSP
- Dry Egg (needs >4MB RAM)
- FalcTron
- Ganymed (start with F1)
- Heretic (very slow)
- Hexogan (use number pad)
- Impulse (Breakout clone)*
- Lamemine
- Les Dinosaures (demo)
- LlamaZap free version (requires joypad, not joystick)
- Madtris
- Nibe
- Running (demo)*
- Radical Race (demo)*
- Spice (Defender clone)*

- Switch
- Tank Blaster
- Tautology (by Reservoir Gods)
- Tautology II* (by Reservoir Gods)
- Toy Man
- Willie's Adventure (preview1), disable DSP
- Willie's Adventure* (preview2)

Games working in EmuTOS >v0.9.0:
- Jeu de Poker
  - needs 640x480@256 VGA mode
- Landmine (GEM minesweeper)
- Let's play Shanghai
  - needs 640x400@256 mode
- Manga Puzzle
  - needs 256 color mode
- Pac Them*
- Santarun (GEM, slowish)
- Vertical Mayhem(+) (Columns clone)*
- Zodiax (Falcon "R-type")
  - No sound (EmuTOS doesn't enabled sound matrix on boot)

Games working in EmuTOS >v0.9.3:
- Chainz:
  - vga, press space at start to disable DSP use
- Jewelz
  - vga, select hatari mode (F2)
- Risk 030 demo
  - Needs 640x480@16 VGA mode
- Sweety Things
- Ultimate Arena Falcon edition:
  - doesn't recognize it's on Falcon -> select "Test"
  - crashes sometimes

Chainz, Jewels, Sweety and Poker games need to be started from 640x480
mode, otherwise EmuTOS constrains mouse movements to too small area.

Games working in EmuTOS >v0.9.5:
- GEM breakout
- The Ultimate Minesweeper (16-color GEM game)
(Earlier EmuTOS versions have problems with mouse clicks)

Games working with extra hacks:
- Bugger, Bunion, SkyFall, Sworm games by Resorvoir Gods:
  - use an undocumented TOS4 vector for keyboard input instead of accessing
    kbdvec correctly which use causes EmuTOS to panic.  This can be worked
    around with the following hack.prg:
    http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=26841274
  - with EmuTOS, enabling DSP freezes the games right at startup
    (with normal TOS4, DSP is used for background music)

Games that might be possible to get working (they show something
and/or don't use DSP XBios calls or DSP sound matrix):
- Block Blizzard preview: stops when loading
- Bomb Squad: crashes to bus error wget at 00fc0002
- Chorensha: works except for joystick directions
- Confusion (demos 1 & 2): title screen doesn't come up
- Conquest of Elysium: screen with garbage
- Gold island (demo, vga only), parts of blits are missing
- Des Lazers & des Hommes: game area graphics are missing
  (they're rendered with DSP)
- It's Great (start from st-med rez): mouse doesn't work
- Masters of Chaos: starts, but then doesn't react to input
- Men at War: freezes at startup
- Multibriques: colors are wrong
- Neurobot: just exits
- Painium: Intro works, but game itself exits to corrupted desktop
- Tetrhex: panics after trying to set 256 color mode
- Tron 2: M68000 Bus Error reading at address $4.
- TsccTron: M68000 Bus Error reading at address $0.
