Hatari and EmuTOS
=================

To run the emulator, a TOS ROM image is needed.  EmuTOS, a free
implementation of TOS, is shipped with the official binary releases
of Hatari.

This tos.img ROM image is identical to the official binary package of
EmuTOS, which is available at the SourceForge website of EmuTOS.  For
downloading other versions or the source code of EmuTOS, please visit
the EmuTOS website.

The tos.img file included with the latest Hatari releases is
the etos512k.img[1] from a preceding EmuTOS release:
- Hatari v2.3.0, v2.3.1:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/1.0/
- Hatari v2.2.0, v2.2.1:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.9.10/

- Hatari v1.0.0, v1.0.1:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.8.3/
- Hatari v0.95:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.8.2/

Earlier Hatari binary releases have included one of the smaller
EmuTOS image files.

[1] the "all languages" version intended mainly for TT & Falcon.
    While the 192k and 256k version on some cases work better
    for ST and STE programs, only the 512k image contains
    support for all the hardware and languages.

Notes for older EmuTOS versions:

* EmuTOS <= v0.9.6:
  EmuTOS changed its INF file format in v0.9.7.  Hatari's Atari
  program autostarting and TOS resolution setting functionality
  supports only EmuTOS >= v0.9.7 INF file format

* EmuTOS <= v0.8.5 with Hatari <= v2.0:
  In order to work with Hatari, EmuTOS v0.8.5 and earlier require
  the FastBoot option to be enabled. This is used to skip some memory
  tests (that Hatari v2.0 and earlier do not support) when EmuTOS
  tries to determine the available RAM size.


What is EmuTOS
==============

EmuTOS is a single-user single-tasking operating system for the 32-bit
Atari computers and emulators.  It can be used as a replacement for
the TOS images needed for using the emulators, and its latest versions
support also wide variety of real hardware.  All the source code is
open and free, licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
A copy of the GNU GPL can be found in the gpl.txt file.

EmuTOS project has home page at SourceForge:
	https://emutos.sourceforge.io/
With sources at GitHub:
	https://github.com/emutos/emutos


EmuTOS usage
============

There are various reasons for using EmuTOS instead of the original
TOS ROM images:

* Legal.  Users who don't have Atari HW or other legal means to obtain
  the original Atari TOS ROMs (for all of the Hatari supported Atari
  versions: ST/STE/TT/Falcon), but would like to try out Hatari and
  see what kind of software the Atari machines had.  EmuTOS gives
  them a legal way to test Hatari with free demos, games etc.

* Performance.  Latest EmuTOS versions boot significantly faster
  than Atari TOS versions.

* Convenience.  EmuTOS doesn't need HD driver to access hard disk
  images, and same 512K image supports all the hardware that different
  Atari TOS versions support.

* Continuity.  Users who want to continue using Atari compatible
  operating systems and need an open source replacement of TOS for
  modifications. Beside EmuTOS, they typically also use FreeMiNT,
  XaAES and fVDI as operating system replacements/improvements.

  This includes users of Atari FPGA clones, such as MiST & MiSTer:
	https://github.com/mist-devel/mist-board/wiki
	https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki
  users of new "Atari" machines, like Atari ColdFire Project:
	http://acp.atari.org/
  and even Amiga (WinUAE) emulator and real Amiga hardware.


EmuTOS compatibility notes
==========================

These comments apply to EmuTOS v1.x.

Many commercial games (e.g. Bombjack, Nebulus, Oids, Super Hang-On,
Turrican, Xenon...) and almost all ST/STe/TT applications work fine
with EmuTOS.

Because (even 192k version of) EmuTOS uses a bit more memory than
normal TOS, badly written (typically floppy-only) games & demos may
blindly overwrite EmuTOS memory. They also often rely on (undocumented)
TOS internal variables & functions being at specific memory locations,
and will crash when they call these bogus addresses, use bogus values,
or call OS functions which internal state they had overwritten with
garbage. For example Omikron Basic and many programs done with it have
this problem.

As a special case of this problem, input (e.g. joystick) doesn't work
in unpatched STOS Basic games as they access it through other means
than XBIOS function Kbdvbase() or by hooking into the IKBD interrupt
vector. They use unofficial system variables which location depends on
the TOS version.

However, ST/STE games that work from HD and/or have been fixed to work
with newer TOS versions, should usually be fine.

Support for Falcon 16-bit resolution is missing and Falcon DSP support
was added only after EmuTOS v1.0.

Additionally, older EmuTOS versions (up to v0.9.1) lacked support for
the (deprecated) line-A graphics functions which are used in many
free/shareware games (ones done with GFA basic etc).  This isn't an
issue with latest EmuTOS versions.

Lists of known issues and incompatible applications are listed in
bugs.txt & incompatible.txt files coming with EmuTOS:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emutos/emutos/master/doc/incompatible.txt


Debugging issues with EmuTOS
============================

EmuTOS debug symbols
--------------------

After loading EmuTOS debug symbols from the file coming with the 512k
EmuTOS image, using debugger "symbols etos512k.sym" command, you can
ask debugger to "trace cpu_symbols", to get trace of all the
(non-static) function calls EmuTOS does.

For smaller EmuTOS versions, there's a script[1] you can use to convert
the emutos2.map file (produced during EmuTOS build) to a format you
can load to Hatari debugger with its "symbols" command[2].

[1] http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29381777
[2] https://hatari.tuxfamily.org/doc/debugger.html#Debug_symbols

After loading the symbols to the Hatari debugger, disassembling the
problematic address should provide more clues for the problem.  Or you
can just look up the program counter value given in the EmuTOS panic
message from the map file.


EmuTOS debug output
-------------------

Start Hatari with "--natfeats on --trace os_base" options to get
EmuTOS debug output (with 512k images), and to redirect EmuTOS panic
output and other console messages to Hatari's console.

For extra debug output and to add your own debug statements, you
need to uncomment following line from suitable EmuTOS source file(s):
	#define ENABLE_KDEBUG 1

And recompile EmuTOS image. Note that you can't do that for whole
EmuTOS as resulting image would be too large.


Other EmuTOS debug output options
---------------------------------

There are debug output options for different HW in EmuTOS "config.h"
header file, but they aren't necessary with NatFeats and console
output redirection.

If you want to test them anyway, below is listed each of them with
Hatari command line options to save their output (to "debug.txt"), and
shortcomings of each option are following:

* MIDI_DEBUG_PRINT: "--midi-in /dev/null --midi-out debug.txt"
  - Hatari needs to be compiled with PortMidi support disabled,
    as PortMidi interprets only real MIDI events

* RS232_DEBUG_PRINT: "--rs232-in /dev/null --rs232-out debug.txt"
  - Mac (BSD libc) is incompatible with Hatari RS232 / SDL2 threading

* SCC_DEBUG_PRINT: "--scc-b-out debug.txt"
  - SCC port is available only on MegaSTE/TT/Falcon

Notes:

* Don't use Hatari stdout/stder ("/dev/stdout", "/dev/stderr") as
  debug output files, unless you absolutely need to get ordering right
  between the extra debug messages and other output, as that results
  in messed up console and output from Hatari

* Both input & output files need to be specified for RS232 & MIDI,
  otherwise Hatari doesn't enable them


Debugging OS calls, Line-A usage and panics
-------------------------------------------

Ask Hatari debugger to stop when the program is started:
-----------
> b pc=TEXT
CPU condition breakpoint 1 with 1 condition(s) added:
pc = TEXT
> c
Returning to emulation...
-----------
(In above example '>' indicates what you type to debugger.)

Then when the debugger is invoked at program startup, you can ask it to:
- collect CPU instruction history
- break on exceptions that trigger the panic
- load symbols + profile what happens, as these will
  provide EmuTOS callstack when debugger is entered
- trace all OS calls and line-A opcodes leading to the panic
with:
-----------
> history on
> setopt -D
Exception debugging enabled.
> symbols etos512k.sym
> profile on
> trace os_all
> b LineAOpcode ! LineAOpcode :trace
CPU condition breakpoint 2 with 1 condition(s) added:
LineAOpcode ! LineAOpcode
-> Track value changes, show value(s) when matched.
-> Trace instead of breaking, but show still hits.
> c
Returning to emulation...
-----------

With above, when the exception causing the panic triggers the debugger,
you see EmuTOS callstack and the OS calls & line-A opcodes leading to it,
and have a panic message on console from which you can copy & paste
relevant parts.

You can then ask what the register values are at that point and what
are the CPU instructions leading to it with the "r" and "history"
commands. Memory state and addresses accessed by the instructions can
be inspected with the "m" command.

For more info on Hatari debugger usage, see the Hatari manual section
on it: https://hatari.tuxfamily.org/doc/debugger.html


Debugging freezes
-----------------

Hatari profiling support can be used to debug OS freezes.  If EmuTOS
gets stuck, just profile it for a while and then ask debugger for a
profile that tells where it's looping.  Then disassemble that part
with EmuTOS symbols directly in Hatari.


EmuTOS free/shareware compatibility lists
=========================================

The compatibility lists below cater mainly for users who don't have
Atari HW and therefore won't have (legal) version of commercial Atari
software and most likely lack motivation to investigate applications
very deeply (Linux offers better alternatives nowadays for most of
that). I.e. the lists skip (most) commercial software and concentrate
on EmuTOS compatibility of freely available games and demos (including
commercial games that have been released later on for free
distribution).

Games that are considered good quality & fun, are marked with "*".
All the listed demos are quite OK.

Most demos can be downloaded from:
	http://pouet.net/
	http://demozoo.org/

Many of the other programs can be found from Atari Mania:
	http://www.atarimania.com/atari-st-tt-falcon.html

And the remaining Atari FTP sites.

Below are first listed ST demos, games, graphics & MIDI applications,
then STE demos, games and music applications, then TT programs and
last Falcon demos, games and applications.


Working Atari ST demos and games
--------------------------------

For STs, 192kB EmuTOS variant is best as it leaves most RAM free.

If ST has more memory, *and* OS speed is important (i.e. app uses
OS drawing functions), 512k variant could be used instead, as that
is compiled with higher optimizations than 192k one.

Some old, floppy only games expect certain memory areas occupied by
EmuTOS, to be over-writable without issues.  These need 192k image.
Some of them can be gotten to work by using EmuTOS cartridge image
(it uses less memory than normal EmuTOS), like this:
	hatari --tos etos192uk.img --cartridge etoscart.img floppy.img

Mostly the non-working games "Panic" EmuTOS during their startup,
but it can happen also later on.

Atari ST games with broken input handling
-----------------------------------------

As expected, STOS games which use STOS routines for input don't work
as STOS does that in TOS binary version specific manner (see EmuTOS
incompatible.txt).

Floppy-only (color) STOS games:
- Diamond Ice       (joystick input doesn't work)
- Islandstrike      (mouse input doesn't work)
- Ozone             (fire at start doesn't work)
- Vidigrid v2       (mouse input doesn't work)

Note that their AUTO-folder starter programs need to be moved to
floppy root and started from there, see EmuTOS incompatible.txt.

GEMDOS HD supporting (color) STOS games:
- Balls Up          (mouse input doesn't work)
- Color Clash*      (fire at start doesn't work)
- Dice II           (mouse doesn't work)
- Heartland         (fire at start doesn't work)
- Mr Dice*          (gets spurious joy input)
- Nostram           (input doesn't work)
- Orbit             (mouse input doesn't work)
- Phantom           (joystick input doesn't work)
- Pipetris          (spurious joystick left input)
- Prehistorik3 demo (spurious joystick left input)
- Reflection*       (keys work, mouse doesn't)
- Roadkill 2        (joystick input doesn't work)
- Skatetribe        (fire at start doesn't work)
- Smash hit         (input doesn't work)
- Sudoku Universe*  (mouse input doesn't work)
- The Rollercoaster Experience (fire at start doesn't work)
- Trackball         (mouse doesn't work)

Even some commercial games use TOS version specific input handling
(see EmuTOS incompatible.txt):
- Brain Blasters / The Teller demo  (input doesn't work)
- Super Cauldron demo  (fire doesn't start game)
- Striker soccer demo  (fire doesn't start game)

Free/shareware color games (more input issues):
- Douglas Rockmoor  (see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)
- Space invaders    (see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)

Mono games (more input issues):
- Crystal Cave*     (line-A bitblit & draw/clear sprite, see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)
- Macro War         (line-A bitblit, see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)
- Ramses*           (panic, see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)

GEM games (more input issues):
- Anduril           (see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)
- Invaders*         (see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)

Working Atari STE programs
--------------------------

There are not that many STE specific (or even STE enhanced) programs:
    http://atari-ste.anvil-soft.com/html/archivapps.htm

But following STE specific & enhanced demos, games and apps work
fine with EmuTOS.

Note: STE emulation needs 256kB variant of EmuTOS.  If you use 60Hz
EmuTOS version (etos256us.img), you may get screen flicker and music
playback issues with demos and games.  You should use at least EmuTOS
version 0.9.4, preferably newer.

Most of the non-GEM ST tracker & chip music composer programs work
also with EmuTOS too (not just STe ones), most even with the 512kB
EmuTOS version.


Non-working Atari STE programs
------------------------------

Some non-working demos:
- Original Beat Maker (OG.PRG, SV2019, by CrazyQ)
  - STE recognization fails with TOS 2.x / EmuTOS -> bus error

Non-working games and music programs:
- Newer Audio Sculpture versions (v1.5beta doesn't handle
  disk access properly, v1.4 has broken crack, v1.1 works)
- Cameleon (see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)
- Hero (STOS, see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)
- Protracker v2 STE, Equinox version (see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)
  - http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=13381


Atari TT programs
-----------------

TT emulation requires 512kB version of EmuTOS (the one shipped with
Hatari).  TT-low (256-color) mode and sound support requires EmuTOS
v0.9.6 or newer.

Working applications:
- Mandelbrot playtime (fracplay, uses FPU)
- M_PLAYER v4.02 (app works also on Falcon, but not with EmuTOS)
  - https://gtello.pagesperso-orange.fr/mplayere.htm
- PixArt4
  - http://www.1632systems.co.uk/www/html/Product/pixart.htm
- Vision v4.7 (works also in ST, but is much nicer in TT low/med)
  - http://jlusetti.free.fr/visione.htm

Working demos:
- 256mbrot, Bragg, Glasstro, Orion-B, Yabt (TT/Falcon intros by ray//.tSCc)
- 4getful (by gwEm, 4KB intro TT-version)
- Adebug 3DTT demo (by Brainstorm)
- CrY image viewer (by .tSCc)
- Mandelbrot explorer (by .tSCc)
- TC fish (by .tSCc)
- TT highres slideshow (by .tSCc)
- Shiny Bubbles TT (by Xanth FX)
- XiTEC demos (by Omega)
  - On exiting Swing EmuTOS panics with privilege violation
    (TOS bombs and continues)

Working games:
- Capy (by YesCREW)
- GEM Breakout
- GEM Klikomania
- GEM Landmine
- GEM Manga Puzzle (needs 256 color mode)
- GEM Milanopoly
- GEM NetHack v3.4.3
- GEM Santarun
- GEM Slashem v3.3.1
- OpenDUNE
- OpenTTD (start from TT-low with 256MBs of TT-RAM)
- Oxyd (Falcon version)
- PM Doom, Heretic & Hexen v0.55 (ports by Patrice Mandin)
- The Ultimate Minesweeper (GEM)

Most of above GEM games run even on ST, but only TT (and Falcon) have
large enough resolution with enough colors for them to be properly
playable.


Falcon programs
---------------

Falcon emulation requires 512kB version of EmuTOS (the one shipped
with Hatari).  Programs using DSP require newer version of EmuTOS than
the v1.0 (current latest release) shipped with Hatari v2.3.

Latest EmuTOS missing (16-bit) HiColor support probably explains
partly why graphics in several demos & games look broken, or they
crash / freeze at startup.

Following Falcon only demos, games and apps work (mostly) fine though.

Games working with extra hacks:
- Bugger, Bunion, SkyFall, Sworm games by Resorvoir Gods:
  - use an undocumented TOS4 vector for keyboard input instead of accessing
    kbdvec correctly which use causes EmuTOS to panic.  This can be worked
    around with the following hack.prg:
    http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=26841274
  - with EmuTOS <=1.0, enabling DSP freezes the games right at startup
    (with normal TOS4, DSP is used for background music)

Partly working games:
- Bomb Squad
  - Game is 4x slower than with TOS4 (see EmuTOS incompatible.txt)

  - Unlike with TOS4, men.prg works only when started by mawintro.prg
- Painium

- AceTracker v1 & v2
- AFM (audio fun machine)
- Apex Media v2.41
  - Viewer TTPs won't work for >256 color images
- Centurbo benchmark
  - DSP speed 2x, and bogus speeds for FPU & CPU as with normal TOS
- Delmpaint (GFA)
   - Due to program bugs, start from 320x200@256 resolution
- DSPdit (by .tscc)
- FlaySID
- Flextracker

  - http://yescrew.atari.org/eng/products.htm
- Graoumf Tracker (v0.8890)
- Iphigenie v1.4b (sound system monitor and manager / DSP LOD loader)
- MP2AUDIO player:
  - outlines (3D look) missing from buttons in the UI
  - Needs to be started from 640x400 or larger resolution, otherwise it
    positions itself completely outside the screen (also with TOS v4)
- Voxx (vocoder), demo and free version
  - GUI looks OK, no idea about actual functionality
  - Needs at minimum 640x480x16 color VGA resolution
- Whip! (virtual light machine)
  - mic input not tested
- Winrec (direct to disk GEM audio recorder/effects)
  - Starts fine and GUI works, actual recording not tested

Applications working with extra hacks:
- Fractal Playground, Godleness, GodBoyX by Reservoir Gods
  - Like RG games, these require "hack.prg", otherwise
    pressing any key crashes them

Partly working applications:
- Animator v0.20.4
  - FLI and FLC viewing works
  - Videos needing HiColor either refuse to run,
    or program crashes on exit leaving desktop
    with broken graphics
- Apex Animator 2.10 (demo)
  - Separate 256-color viewers programs work, HiColor ones don't
- Apex Alpha (demo)
  - Works with MMU + FPU + VGA
  - Requires HiColor with RGB?
- AVI030
  - Extra text cursors visible on screen and panics after video exits
    (HiColor support?)
- FalcAMP (GEM, requires DSP & color icons support)
  - 3D look missing from icons, and text from plugins dialog
- Escape paint (GEM, requires color icons support)
  - Setting windows can't be moved, their titlebars and borders aren't
    refreshed when exposed, and few of the settings windows don't come
    on screen

Broken applications (even with EmuTOS >v1.0):
- Centview (GEM image viewer)
  - Crashes to NULL pointer access when viewing image
  - Requires HiColor
- Indypaint
  - cursor moves, but screen is black, F1-F4 keys don't work
  - requires HiColor
