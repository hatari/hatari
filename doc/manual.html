<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>General description</h3>
<p>
Hatari is an Atari ST, STE, TT and Falcon emulator for Linux, *BSD, macOS,
Windows and other Systems which are supported by the SDL library.
The emulator is open source software and is distributed under the terms of the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU General
Public License (GPL)</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Atari ST was a 16/32-bit computer system which was first released by Atari
in 1985. Using the Motorola 68000 CPU, it was a very popular computer having
quite a lot of CPU power at that time. See Appendix B for details on emulation
in general.
</p>
<p>
Unlike many other Atari emulators which try to give you a good
environment for running GEM applications, Hatari tries to emulate the hardware
as close as possible so that it is able to run most of the old games
and demos. Of course you can run normal GEM applications with Hatari, too.

</p>

<p>See the developers' <span class="file">doc/todo.txt</span> file
(included with Hatari sources) for the details on the few remaining
emulation gaps and the <a href="compatibility.html">Hatari Atari
Software Compatibility List</a> for which Atari programs are known
to be affected by them.</p>


<h3>System requirements</h3>

<p>
Hatari needs a fast machine (1 GHz or more for ST/STE emulation, &gt; 2 GHz
for Falcon emulation) which is running a POSIX compatible operating system
(preferably GNU/Linux) that supports the SDL library.
There are also some ports to other operating systems like macOS or Windows,
but they are not used by the developers, so such builds are normally not very
well tested.
</p>

<h2>Compiling and running</h2>

<h3>Compiling Hatari</h3>

<p>Required:</p>
<ul>
<li>A C compiler that supports the "gnu99" C extensions. Thus any recent
 versions of GCC or clang should be fine.</li>
<li>A working CMake installation (version 3.3 or newer). See
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/">http://www.cmake.org/</a> for details.
</li>
<li>The SDL library v2.0.6 or newer. You can get it from
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">http://www.libsdl.org/</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Optional:</p>
<ul>
<li>The zLib compression library for supporting compressed disk images. You
can get it from <a href="https://zlib.net/">https://zlib.net/</a>.
</li>
<li>The PNG image library for PNG format screenshots and to
decrease AVI video recording file sizes. You can get it from
<a href="http://www.libpng.org/">http://www.libpng.org/</a>.</li>
<li>The GNU Readline library for <a href="debugger.html">Hatari debugger</a>
command line editing.</li>
<li>The Xlib library to support Hatari Python UI window embedding
on systems with the X window system (Linux and other unixes).</li>
<li>The PortMidi library required for MIDI device support on macOS and Windows
<a href="http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/">http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/</a>.</li>
<li>The udev library for NatFeats SCSI driver media change detection (Linux).</li>
<li>The IPF support library
<a href="http://www.softpres.org/download">http://www.softpres.org/download</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The versions available in your Linux distribution will be sufficient
in most cases, but make sure you have also the header files installed
for the libraries as well! Typically they are in a corresponding -dev
package.
</p>

<p>
After you have verified that you have the required libraries and their
development files, change to the <span class="file">hatari/</span>
directory.  Create a <span class="file">build/</span> directory under
it and configure the build system for your environment:
<pre>
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
</pre>
<p>
Then compile Hatari by typing <span class="commandline">make</span>.
If all works fine, you'll get the executable <span class="commandline">hatari</span>
in the src/ subdirectory.
</p>
<p>
Note: Instead of calling CMake directly, you can also use the supplied
configure script to run CMake and to give the arguments (like install
prefix) in a format familiar from GNU Autotools using programs.  Type
"<span class="commandline">./configure --help</span>"
to see all the options supported by this script.
</p>

<h3>Installation of a TOS ROM</h3>

<p>
Before you can start Hatari, you have to copy a TOS ROM image to the data
directory (<span class="file">&lt;prefix&gt;/share/hatari/</span>, by
default <span class="file">/usr/local/share/hatari/</span>) and
rename it to <span class="commandline">tos.img</span>, or use the
<span class="commandline">--tos</span> command line option to tell
Hatari where to find a TOS ROM.
Hatari needs a TOS ROM image because this contains the operating system
of the emulated Atari.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately it is not possible to ship an original ROM
image with the Hatari package since these images are still copyrighted.
But you can easily create an image with a real Atari machine and one of
those various ROM-image programs for them (search for "TOSDUMP" with your
favourite internet search engine).</p>
<p> Another solution is EmuTOS, which is also shipped with the official
release versions of Hatari. EmuTOS is an open-source TOS clone. You can find
it at:
<a href="https://emutos.sourceforge.io/">https://emutos.sourceforge.io/</a>.
While it works fine with most Atari software, it is not the best
solution for Falcon emulation due to missing TrueColor mode support,
or for playing old (disk only) games and other software tied to
specific TOS version(s) (see <span class="file">emutos.txt</span>
for more details).
However, it is free, its 1024k version supports all Atari machines
emulated by Hatari, it supports more languages than original TOS, does
not require a driver to support harddisk images, and it boots faster
than original TOS.</p>
<p>If you do not specify a TOS image on the commandline and Hatari
cannot find a suitable TOS image in the default dir, you'll get the
chance to select a TOS image file from the GUI. </p>

<h3>Installation of the binary</h3>

<p> Type <span class="commandline">make install</span> as "root" user to
do a systemwide installation.</p>
<p>Assuming you didn't change the default installation prefix and that
<span class="file">/usr/local/bin/</span> is in your PATH, you should
be now able to start the Hatari executable from anywhere.</p>
<p> When you finally have got a TOS image, try starting Hatari with the
option <span class="commandline">--help</span> to find out more about
its command line parameters. </p>

<h3>Running Hatari for the first time</h3>

<p> Now type <span class="commandline">hatari</span> to run the
emulator for the first time. If all goes
well, you should now be presented with a window showing you the
familiar
little green desktop of the Atari ST. Press <span class="key">F12</span>
to turn on the GUI to
configure Hatari to suit your needs, press <span class="key">F11</span>
to toggle windowed and fullscreen mode. </p>

<h3>Configuration options precedence</h3>

<p>Hatari settings can come from several sources, with later ones
overriding the earlier given ones:
<ul>
<li>Builtin Hatari default options</li>
<li>Global <span class="commandline">/etc/hatari.cfg</span>
    (or <span class="commandline">/usr/local/etc/hatari.cfg</span>)
    configuration file</li>
<li>User specific <span class="commandline">~/.config/hatari/hatari.cfg</span>
    configuration file</li>
<li>Command line arguments</li>
<li>Option changes done at run-time in Hatari options GUI, with the
    <a href="debugger.html">Hatari debugger</a> "setopt" command, or through
    the (optionally enabled) Hatari command FIFO or control socket</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the run-time changes require emulation to be reset for them
to take effect.  In most cases, Hatari will do that automatically when
needed.</p>


<h2>Command line options and arguments</h2>

<p>Usage:</p>
<pre>
 hatari [options] [disk image | directory | Atari program ]
</pre>

<p>As an argument one can give either a name of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A floppy disk image,</li>
<li>A directory that should be emulated as a virtual GEMDOS HD, or</li>
<li>An Atari program that should be autostarted.  In this case
    the program's directory will be used as the C: drive from
    where this program will be started.
</li>
</ul>
(These arguments are shortcuts for "--disk-a", "--harddisk" and "--auto"
options listed below.)

<p>Booting will be done from the disk image or directory that's given
last on the command line as an option or the argument (and which
corresponds to A: or C:).</p>

<p>Hatari command line options are split into several categories:</p>

<p class="parameter">--max-width &lt;x&gt;</p>
<p class="paramdesc">Preferred / maximum Hatari screen width</p>
<p class="parameter">--max-height &lt;x&gt;</p>
<p class="paramdesc">Preferred / maximum Hatari screen height.
</p><p class="paramdesc">
Maximum width and height options are part of Hatari's Atari monitor
emulation. They limit the size Hatari should aim for its internal SDL
framebuffer, and how much of the Atari screen borders are visible.
</p><p class="paramdesc">
On an SDL2 build, framebuffer is then scaled to the Hatari output
window based on the specified Hatari zoom factor (see below).
</p><p class="paramdesc">
Aim of this is to have all resolutions show up in approximately same
size, like on a real Atari monitor. Hatari's internal integer scaling
support sets some limits on this, so it's an expert option.
</p><p class="paramdesc">
Note: Only reason to change the defaults, should be limiting this to a
smaller resolution for performance reasons, e.g. for video recording,
or on really underpowered systems, to make monitor do all of the
ST-low resolution scaling by forcing Hatari to ask SDL for CGA / QVGA
resolution.
</p>
<p class="parameter">-z, --zoom &lt;x&gt;</p>
<p class="paramdesc">
This option overrides max width/height options so that e.g. ST-low
resolution gets always doubled, and all resolutions (except TT-high)
have approximately the same size, like on a real CRT monitor.
</p><p class="paramdesc">
Zoom factor is then used to scale that up (or down) to the Hatari
output window.  This way scaling results always in approximately
same sized Hatari window.
</p><p class="paramdesc">
With non-integer zoom factors, linear scaling is used to smooth out
the output, with integer zoom factors, scaling is done using nearest
neighboring pixels for sharper output.  This applies also to window
resizes.
</p><p class="paramdesc">
To avoid zooming for low ST resolutions, use "--zoom 1 --max-width 416
--max-height 276" (if you don't need borders, 320x200 size is enough).
Disabling low resolution doubling like this is not recommended for
Falcon emulation because TOS v4 bootup and some demos switch
resolutions frequently.
</p>
<p class="parameter">--disable-video
&lt;bool&gt;</p>

<p class="parameter">--video-timing
&lt;x&gt;</p>
<p class="paramdesc">Wakeup State for MMU/GLUE (x=ws1/ws2/ws3/ws4/random,
default ws3). When powering on, the STF will randomly choose one of these
wake up states. The state will then affect the timings where border removals
and other video tricks should be made, which can give different results on
screen. For example, WS3 is known to be compatible with many demos, while WS1 can show
more problems.</p>

<h3>TT/Falcon specific display options</h3>
<p>
Zooming to sizes specified below is internally done using integer scaling
factors. This means that different Atari resolutions may show up with
different sizes, but they are never blurry.
<p class="parameter">--desktop &lt;bool&gt;</p>
<p class="paramdesc">Whether to use desktop resolution on
fullscreen to avoid issues related to resolution switching.
Otherwise fullscreen will use a resolution that is closest to the
Hatari window size. (enabled by default)</p>
<p class="parameter">--force-max
&lt;bool&gt;</p>
<p class="paramdesc">Hatari window size is forced to
specified maximum size and black borders used when Atari resolution
doesn&rsquo;t scale evenly to it. This is most useful when
recording videos of Falcon demos that change their resolution.
(disabled by default)</p>
<p class="parameter">--aspect
&lt;bool&gt;</p>
<p class="paramdesc">Whether to do monitor aspect ratio
correction (enabled by default)</p>

<h3>VDI options</h3>
<p class="parameter">--vdi
&lt;bool&gt;</p>
<p class="paramdesc">
Whether to use VDI screen mode.  Doesn't work with TOS v4. TOS v3
memory detection isn't compatible with larger VDI modes (i.e. you need
to skip the detection at boot). Original TOS desktops use wrong window
size in 2-plane (4 color) VDI mode when screen height &gt;= 400 pixels.
Because of these issues, using EmuTOS is recommended for VDI mode
</p>
<p class="parameter">--vdi-planes
&lt;x&gt;</p>
<p class="paramdesc">Use extended VDI resolution with bit
depth &lt;x&gt; (x = 1, 2 or 4)</p>

&lt;h&gt;</p>
<p class="paramdesc">Use extended VDI resolution with height
&lt;h&gt; (160 &lt; h &lt;= 1280)</p>
<p>
Because TOS and popular GEM programs have problems with certain screen
sizes, Hatari enforces restrictions on VDI screen size.  In total VDI
screen size is limited to 32-300kB, width to multiple of 16 pixels,
and height to multiple of 8 pixels (smaller system font height). That
translates to following maximum standard resolutions for the VDI mode:
</p>
<p class="parameter">monochrome</p>

<p class="parameter">--png-level &lt;x&gt;</p>
<p class="paramdesc">Select PNG compression level for AVI video (x = 0-9).
Both compression efficiency and speed depend on the compressed
screen content. Highest compression level (9) can be <em>really</em>
slow with some content. Levels 3-6 should compress nearly as well
with clearly smaller CPU overhead.</p>

<p class="paramdesc">GEMDOS HD emulation. Emulate hard disk partition(s)
with &lt;dir&gt; contents. If directory contains only single letter
(C-Z) subdirectories, each of these subdirectories will be treated

microphone</p>
<p class="parameter">--sound
&lt;x&gt;</p>
<p class="paramdesc">Sound frequency: 6000-50066. "off"
disables the sound and speeds up the emulation. To prevent extra
sound artifacts, the frequency should be selected so that it either
matches evenly with the STE/TT/Falcon sound DMA (6258, 12517,
250033, 50066 Hz) or your sound card frequencies (11025, 22050,
44100 or 6000...48000 Hz). Check what your sound card supports.</p>
<p class="parameter">--sound-buffer-size
&lt;x&gt;</p>
<p class="paramdesc">SDL&rsquo;s sound buffer size: 10-100,
or 0 to use default buffer size. By default Hatari uses an SDL
buffer size of 1024 samples, which gives approximately 20-30 ms
of sound depending on the chosen sound frequency. Under some OS or
with not fully supported sound card, this default setting can cause
a bigger delay at lower frequency (nearly 0.5 sec). In that case,
you can use this option to force the size of the sound buffer to a
fixed number of milliseconds of sound (using 20 is often a good
choice if you have such problems). Most users will not need this
option.</p>
<p class="parameter">--sound-sync
&lt;bool&gt;</p>
<p class="paramdesc">The emulation rate is nudged by +100 or
0 or -100 micro-seconds on occasion. This prevents the sound buffer
from overflowing (long latency and lost samples) or underflowing
(short latency and repeated samples). The emulation rate smoothly
deviates by a maximum of 0.58% until synchronized, while the
emulator continuously generates every sound sample and the crystal
controlled sound system consumes every sample.<br />
(on|off, off=default)</p>
<p class="parameter">--ym-mixing
&lt;x&gt;</p>
<p class="paramdesc">Select a method for mixing the three

screenshots. XBios(11) Dbmsg call can be used to invoke the debugger.
</p>
<p class="parameter">--conout &lt;device&gt;</p>
<p class="paramdesc">Enable console (xconout vector functions) output
redirection for given &lt;device&gt; to host terminal.  Device 2 is for

<h2>Using the emulated system</h2>

<p> Once you have started Hatari successfully, you can use the emulator as
an almost complete Atari ST computer system. </p>

<h3>The GUI</h3>

<p>Press <span class="key">F12</span> to enter the GUI. Navigate it
with the mouse.
The GUI is rather self explanatory.</p>

<h4 class="gui">The Main Menu</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
  <img src="images/main.png" width="500" height="304"
       alt="Hatari's GUI - the main menu" />
</div>

<p>
You can reach the other setup dialogs from the main menu by clicking on
the appropriate buttons.
</p>
<p>
You can load the current settings from a configuration file by clicking
on the <span class="button">Load&nbsp;config</span> button, and save
the current settings to a configuration file by clicking on
the <span class="button">Save&nbsp;config</span> button.
</p>
<p>
Click <span class="button">OK</span> to go back and continue the emulation.
All changed options will be applied.
</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em>Any changes to machine ROM or HW configuration
mean that emulation is reset to apply the change.  Don't do that
unless you're OK to lose your current emulation state.</p>
<p>
Select the <em>&quot;Reset machine&quot;</em> option if you
want the emulated machine to perform a cold reset. This is equal to
switching the power off and on again on a real Atari machine.
</p>
<p>
Click <span class="button">Quit</span> to terminate Hatari
and return to the host OS.
</p>
<p>
Click <span class="button">Cancel</span> to abandon any
changes that you have made.
</p>
<p>
(There are also keyboard shortcuts to do several of these actions.)
</p>


<h4 class="gui">The File Selector Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
  <img src="images/fileselector.png" width="640" height="400"
       alt="Hatari's GUI - the fileselector" />
</div>

<p>
 The file selector dialog appears whenever you are prompted to choose a file
 or folder.
</p>
<p>
 To enter a folder or choose a file, simply click on the entry in the
 main box of the dialog. To navigate in the file list, you can use the
 scrollbar on the right with mouse, use mousewheel, keyboard up + down
 arrow (with Alt), or page up + down keys.
</p>
<p>
 You can use the three buttons in the upper right corner for additional folder
 navigation. Click the <span class="button">..</span> button to go up one level
 in the directory tree. The <span class="button">CWD</span> button takes you
 to the current working directory (i.e. the folder that was current when
 Hatari has been started). Click the <span class="button">~</span> button to
 return to your home directory. The <span class="button">/</span> button can
 be clicked to go to the root directory of the file system.
</p>
<p>
 When you tick the <em>&quot;Show hidden files&quot;</em> setting, Hatari will
 also show files that start with a dot in the file selection dialog.
</p>

<h4 class="gui">The System Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
  <img src="images/system.png" width="500" height="288"
       alt="Hatari's GUI - the system dialog" />
</div>

<p>
 The system dialog can be used to define the basic hardware attributes of
 the machine that should be emulated.
</p>
<p>
 The machine type option is used to select the type of Atari computer to
 be emulated:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  The <strong>ST</strong> was the very first 16/32-bit computer from Atari.
  Most older games and demos require an ST. TOS 1.00, 1.02, 1.04 or 2.06
  is required for running in ST mode.</li>
 <li>
  The <strong>Mega-ST</strong> was an slightly improved version which also
  provided the so-called blitter chip (for accelerating certain graphic
  operations) and a Real Time Clock (RTC) chip. A note for experts: Hatari
  emulates the Mega-ST with the so-called IMP chipset, while the normal
  ST is emulated with the Ricoh chipset. This gives a slightly different
  behavior between the two machine types with regards to bus errors.
 </li>
 <li>
  The <strong>STE</strong> was introduced some years later and had some more
  advanced hardware features, like the blitter chip, hardware scrolling and
  DMA sample sound (but no Real Time Clock). There are not that many demos or
  games that really require an STE but since most normal ST games/demos also
  work with an STE, it is normally safe to always work in STE mode.
  Also make sure to use TOS version 1.06, 1.62 or 2.0x with this machine type.
 </li>
 <li>
  The <strong>Mega-STE</strong> was an improved version of the STE, with
  16 MHz (instead of 8 MHz) CPU frequency, a built-in Real Time Clock
  chip, and a VME bus.
 </li>
 <li>
   The <strong>TT</strong> was the advanced workstation from Atari. It
   featured a 32MHz 68030 CPU, a very high monochrome resolution, and a
   lot of interfaces. However, compatibility was not as high as with the
   other machines. For TT emulation you need TOS 3.0x.
 </li>
 <li>
  The <strong>Falcon</strong> was Atari's last computer, using a 16 MHz 68030
  CPU and some more interesting new hardware feature, like the Videl graphic
  chip and DSP 56001 for audio processing. You need TOS 4.0x for running in
  Falcon mode.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 <em>Note:</em> Falcon and especially TT emulation are still considered as
 experimental and incomplete, so quite a bunch of programs do not work very
 well yet.
 Also a lot of old games and demos do not work with these machine types
 anymore since the hardware is quite a bit different. There were only very
 few programs that were made for the TT exclusively, while there were some
 interesting games and demos specially made for the Falcon.
</p>

<p>
 The video timings (&quot;wakestate&quot;) settings influence the internal
 timings of the ST video chip emulation. You normally do not have to change
 these unless you know what you are doing, only some very few demos require
 a special setting here.
</p>

<p>
 For Falcon mode, you can choose whether you want to disable DSP emulation,
 fake it or enable full emulation. Most Falcon programs only play sound or work
 correctly when you enable the DSP emulation, but it needs a lot of host CPU
 power (more than 2 GHz) for full emulation. So if you have a slow host CPU,
 you can try if your Falcon program also runs with DSP disabled or in
 the &quot;dummy&quot; fake mode.
 Note that you cannot change this option while the DSP based program already
 runs.
</p>
<p>
 The check boxes in the &quot;CPU and system parameters&quot; section can
 be used to fine-tune the machine and CPU types.
</p>
<p>
 The Blitter option can be set to enable Blitter emulation in plain ST mode.
 The Blitter is a custom chip that accelerates some graphical operations.
 Note that in Mega-ST, STE and Falcon mode, the Blitter is always enabled
 (since these machines have always been sold with a Blitter chip). The TT
 was always shipped without the Blitter chip.
</p>
<p>
 The &quot;Patch Timer-D&quot; option changes the Timer-D initialization from
 TOS. TOS uses the MFP timer D as a baudrate generator for RS232. However, the
 TOS default value slows down the emulation. The patch gives you a better
 performance.  It is normally safe to enable the patch, but if you encounter a
 program that does not work, you can try to disable the patch to see if it
 works better.
</p>
<p>
 With the &quot;Boot faster&quot; option, Hatari patches the TOS ROM and some
 system variables, to speed up the boot process of the emulated system, e.g.
 by simulating a warm reset. This is a convenient option, but some very few old
 programs rely on an unmodified boot process, so in rare cases this option has
 to be switched off to get those programs running.
</p>
<p>
 <em>NOTE:</em> The emulated Atari system is very very sensitive to all of
 these options so Hatari will automatically reset the emulation when
 changes to (most of) these settings are applied.  Rest of the settings
 apply to next boot.
</p>
<p>
 Most settings are also selected automatically when one uses the
 <span class="commandline">--machine</span> command line option.
</p>


<h4 class="gui">The CPU Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
  <img src="images/cpu.png" width="439" height="384"
       alt="Hatari's GUI - the CPU dialog" />
</div>

<h5>CPU type</h5>

<p>
 The CPU type option can be used to select the level of the central processing
 unit. If you are not sure what to use, simply select 68000 for ST and STE
 machines and 68030 for TT and Falcon emulation, since these were the original
 configurations used in the Atari computers. In case you want to vary
 the CPU type, you should be aware of some constraints:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Atari ST and STE have only been shipped with a 68000 CPU, so for best
  compatibility with old programs, you should choose this CPU type.
 </li>
 <li>
  If you are going to use TOS 1.0x, you also have to select the 68000 CPU,
  since these TOS versions are not aware of the higher CPU levels yet.
  If you want to use a higher CPU level with the ST or STE machine type,
  you have to use TOS 2.0x instead.
 </li>
 <li>
  Atari TT and Falcon computers were using the 68030 CPU, so you should select
  the 68030 CPU type for these machines.
 </li>
 <li>
  TOS 3.0x and 4.0x also only work with a CPU &gt;= 68020.
 </li>
 <li>
  68010 and 68040, 68060 have never been used in official Atari computers,
  so don't use these CPU types without a good reason.
 </li>
 <li>
  The 68060 option is currently considered as experimental, so do not use
  this option unless you know what you are doing.
 </li>
</ul>

<h5>CPU options</h5>

<p>
 The CPU clock option can be used to select the frequency that is used
 to clock the CPU. 8 MHz is the standard for ST and STE and the most
 compatible frequency for old software. The CPU in the TT was clocked
 with 32 MHz. The original Mega STE and Falcon could be run in both,
 8 MHz and 16 MHz with the possibility to toggle between the two frequencies
 during runtime via software. Hatari supports this feature, too, so it is
 possible to switch between 8 and 16 MHz from the emulated side, e.g. with
 certain accessories or CPX. However, if you select 32 MHz or a non-standard
 CPU in the Hatari GUI, this feature is disabled, since Hatari assumes that
 you rather want to emulate a system with an accelerator CPU board (which
 don't implement this the software frequency switching).
</p>

<p>
 The &quot;Prefetch mode&quot; option is used to enable the emulation of 68k
 address errors and the so-called CPU prefetch buffer. This is needed for best
 compatibility, but it slows down emulation a little bit so you can disable it
 if you don't need it and if you have a slow host system.
</p>
<p>
 The &quot;Cycle exact&quot;, the &quot;MMU emulation&quot; and
 &quot;24-bit addressing&quot; options are considered as experimental and
 should only be changed if you know what you are doing.
</p>

<h5>FPU type</h5>

<p>
 The FPU settings can be used to select the type of floating point unit
 of &gt;= 68020 CPUs. (68882) FPU is enabled by default only for TT
 machines, as they were only ones that originally shipped with one.
</p>
<p>
 When emulating the Motorola FPU, PC host FPU can be used to do the math.
 This is the default and fastest method, but its results have some slight
 differences compared to a real Motorala FPU.
</p>
<p>
 For higher precision, you can select the "Accurate FPU emulation" mode:
 this will emulate all the FPU operations using only the CPU and with
 the same rules as the Motorala's FPU. This emulation is bit-exact
 (except for the last few bits in trig/log functions), and a little
 slower than using host FPU.
</p>


<h4 class="gui">The Floppy Disks Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
  <img src="images/floppydisks.png" width="640" height="320"
       alt="Hatari's GUI - the floppy disks dialog" />
</div>

<p>
 This dialog can be used to choose which floppy disks should be emulated
 in the disk drives. You can use most standard Atari ST disk image files.
 You may select and browse also zipped disk images. See
 <a href="#Floppy_disk_images">"Floppy disk images"</a> section for details.
</p>
<p>
 Each drive can be enabled or disabled (as if it was not connected or turned
 off). You can also choose to emulate a single sided drive instead of a double
 sided one (some games or demos will have a different behaviour in single sided
 mode).
</p>
<p>
 Click on the button <span class="button">Browse</span> next to the
 A: and B: option to go to the fileselector to choose a disk image for the
 corresponding drive.
</p>
<p>Click on <span class="button">Eject</span> to eject a disk image
from the emulated drive. The emulated ST will act as if had no floppy
disk in its drive.</p>
<p>You can specify a default directory where Hatari will start to
browse the filesystem.</p>
<p>
Check the "Auto insert B" option if you want Hatari to be smart and
insert the second disk of a two disk game automatically.
Some games then use the second drive automatically.
In the case that a game is not able to find the disk in the second drive,
you have to insert the second disk in drive A: manually when prompted.
<br />
<em>NOTE:</em> This option only works properly if the file name of the
first disks ends with an 'a' before the extension and the second disk name
ends with a 'b'.
</p>
<p>
 Select if you want to use fast FDC (Floppy Disk Controller) emulation.

 "Fast floppy access" option will speed up disk accesses, but this can
 cause incompatibilities with programs that expect correct delays
 (some games/demos don't expect data to be read too fast from the
 disk). For example, when using STX images, most protections will fail
 if fast floppy access is enabled.
</p>
<p>
 If you want, you can set Hatari to write-protect your disks. Atari ST
 viruses can spread on disk images, so that can be a good idea. However,
 note that some programs won't work correctly (or at all) with write
 protected disks, and things like saving highscores in games will fail.
</p>

<div class="floatimage">
  <img src="images/newfloppy.png" width="290" height="224"
       alt="Hatari's GUI - the new floppy dialog" />
</div>

<p>
 If you need to create a new blank disk image, click on
 <span class="button">Create&nbsp;blank&nbsp;image</span>.
 Parameters for the new image can be set in the following dialog. HD
 and ED disk sector counts are for larger, non-Atari disk sizes, they
 can be useful with programs that don't work from hard drive, or with
 with GEMDOS HD emulation.
 Click on <span class="button">Create</span> to save the new image or on
 <span class="button">Back</span> to return to the disk dialog.
</p>
<p>
 After clicking <span class="button">Create</span>, a fileselector
 appears. You can browse the filesystem now. Select the target directory,
 click beside "File:" and type in a name for the new disk image.
 The name should terminate with .st or .msa.
</p>
<p>
 Hatari can currently create plain .ST and .MSA disk images exclusively.
 <span class="commandline">hmsa</span> command line utility can be used
 to convert disk images between .ST and .MSA formats.
</p>


<h4 class="gui">The Hard Disks Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
  <img src="images/harddisks.png" width="640" height="400"
       alt="Hatari's GUI - the hard disks dialog" />
</div>

<p>
 This dialog can be used to change the hard disk settings.
</p>
<p>
 Here you can select a hard disk image file for ACSI, SCSI or IDE hard drive
 emulation, or you can select a host directory to be emulated as the Atari
 hard drive. Use the arrow buttons to select the ID of the drive that you
 want to set, then click on <span class="button">Browse</span> to choose
 a file which should be used for providing the contents of the hard disk,
 or click on <span class="button">Eject</span> to disable the current ID.
</p>
<p>
 IDE controllers are using a 16-bit interface, so depending on where the
 contents of a real hard disk have initially been created (on an Atari
 machine or on a PC), and depending on where the contents have been read
 out from the disk, 16-bit values in the image might be byte-swapped.
 Hatari can either try to detect this situation automatically (when
 &quot;Auto&quot; is selected), or you can tell Hatari whether it should
 always byte-swap the disk image contents or not.
</p>
<p>
 GEMDOS HD emulation can be used to provide a folder on your host
 computer file system as hard drive(s) to the emulated Atari. Select
 <span class="button">Browse</span> to choose a folder, or
 <span class="button">Eject</span> to disable the drive(s) again.
 <br/>
 The &quot;Atari &lt;-&gt; host 8-bit filename conversion&quot; setting
 can be used to tell Hatari whether it should try to convert the character
 set of the file names on the host to the Atari character set, since
 modern operating systems use different character sets than Atari TOS.
 File name conversion option is best-effort conversion between
 the host OS and Atari character set for the non-ASCII file names
 exposed by the GEMDOS HD emulation.
 <br/>
 GEMDOS HD emulation can override partition(s) from HD images.
 With "Add GEMDOS HD after ACSI/SCSI/IDE partitions" option Hatari
 tries to assign it to a drive after the partitions on HD images,
 instead of C: (whether that works correctly depends on whether
 your emulated Atari hard disk interprets the HD images partition
 tables similarly to Hatari, and whether it starts assigning them
 from C: onwards). As a last resort, you can use "--gemdos-drive"
 command line option to explicitly specify which drive should be
 used for GEMDOS HD.
 <br/>
 Finally, you can also choose whether you want to provide the files on
 GEMDOS HD only as write-protected to the Atari environment or not,
 or whether you want Hatari to select this status automatically depending
 on the file attributes of the file in the host file system.
</p>
<p>
 Check "Boot from HD" to set given hard disk image / directory as TOS
 boot device (if ACSI or IDE is enabled, it is C:, otherwise it is the
 first specified GEMDOS HD drive).  With command line options, the value
 of this setting depends on whether you specify floppy image or harddisk
 later on the command line (later one takes precedence).
</p>
<p>
 Note that you need TOS version &gt;= 2.05 to boot from IDE hard drive.
 ACSI hard drive emulation does not work with TOS 4.0x in Falcon mode.
 For SCSI emulation, you either need to run with TT or Falcon emulation.
 Please also refer to the <a href="#Hard_disk_support">Hard disk support</a>
 section for more details about hard disk emulation.
</p>


<h4 class="gui">The Memory Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
  <img src="images/memory.png" width="400" height="400"
       alt="Hatari's GUI - the memory dialog" />
</div>

<p>You can select the amount of RAM for the emulated machine here.
While Hatari allows 14 MiB for all machine types, on real HW, ST/STE can
have up to 4 MiB, MegaSTE/TT up to 10MiB, and Falcon up to 14 MiB RAM. Of
values below 4 MiB, only ones that were valid on a real unmodified STFM
are available</p>
<p>TT RAM size allows to emulate up to 1024 MiB of 32-bit RAM. This is
only useful in Falcon and TT mode, and require to disable "24 bit
addressing" mode in the CPU options (Hatari needs to patch Falcon TOS
v4 for this)
<p>Here you will find the options to save memory snapshots as well.</p>
<p>Click on <span class="button">Save</span> to save a memory snapshot
to file. You can select a new filename here.</p>
<p>Click on <span class="button">Restore</span> to restore a memory
snapshot from a file. Use the fileselector to select the snapshot to be
restored.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> Memory snapshots are not interchangeable between
different versions of Hatari. e.g. if you compile a newer Hatari, you
cannot load your old memory snapshots back.</p>


<h4 class="gui">The ROM Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
  <img src="images/tos.png" width="519" height="367"
       alt="Hatari's GUI - the ROM dialog" />
</div>

<p>Here you can select the TOS image to use. Click on <span
 class="button">Browse</span> to select it via the fileselector.
You can also select an optional cartridge image to use. Click on <span
 class="button">Browse</span> to select one via the fileselector. Click on <span
 class="button">Eject</span> to disconnect the custom cartridge image.
</p>
<p>
Depending on the machine type that you want to emulate, you can either use
EmuTOS (see emutos.txt for more info), or a TOS version that supports
the machine type.
For ST mode, use TOS 1.00, 1.02, 1.04 or 2.06.
For STE mode, use TOS 1.06, 1.62, 2.05 or 2.06.
If you want to use the TT mode, you must specify a TOS 3.05 or 3.06 image here.
And in Falcon mode, you have to use either TOS 4.00, 4.02, 4.04 or 4.92. However,
you should always use TOS 4.04 for Falcon mode, it is the most common one.
Also note that TOS 4.92 cannot be booted from a boot disk (like it is done on a
real Falcon), you have to specify it directly in the TOS ROM setup dialog here.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that any custom cartridge image will not work together with
GEMDOS HD emulation or the VDI extended resolution emulation
since some additional driver code will be used in the cartridge memory
space for these emulations.
</p>


<h4 class="gui">The Joystick Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
  <img src="images/joystick.png" width="320" height="336"
       alt="Hatari's GUI - the joystick dialog" />
</div>

<p>In this dialog, you can configure the emulated joysticks.
With the upper two arrows, you can choose the joystick which you want to
configure.</p>
<p>Joystick 1 is the normal ST joystick port and 99.9% of all ST games
use this port.
Joystick 0 emulates a joystick plugged into the ST mouse port
and is often used in games for two players.</p>
<p>With STE joypad A and B, you can enable the emulation of Jaguar joypads
which are plugged in the enhanced joystick ports of the Atari STE.
Only very few STE games support these joypads, so you often won't need this
(but some Falcon games require them).</p>
<p>Finally, Hatari also emulates joysticks which were plugged on the parallel
port with a special adapter on a real ST. These were used in some few
multi-player games like "Gauntlet 2".</p>
<p>For each ST joystick, choose whether you want to disable it,
use the keyboard for emulation or use a real PC joystick.</p>
<p>For keyboard emulation, you can select the keys by pressing the
<span class="button">Define&nbsp;keys</span> button. You will be prompted to press
the keys for up, down, left, right and fire.</p>
<p>If you want to use a real PC joystick for the emulation, you should connect
it to your PC before you start Hatari. Then you can choose the joystick with
the two lower arrows.</p>
<p>Check the "Enable autofire" option if you are too lazy to pound
on the fire button in shoot'em-up games. However, this option only works with
certain games. In some other games, it gets worse if you enable this option.</p>
<p>"Button 2" options select whether (real joystick) fire button 2
emulates joystick up or a SPACE key press. Unless game explicitly
queries other joysticks, latter will work only for joystick 1 (queried
also by TOS). If SPACE key gets stuck down (can happen if querying
given joystick stops while button 2 is kept down), visiting Joystick
setup dialog will fix that.</p>
<p>See <a href="#Emulated_joystick">Emulated joystick</a> section for details.</p>


<h4 class="gui">The Atari Monitor Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
  <img src="images/monitor.png" width="340" height="304"
       alt="Hatari's GUI - the Atari monitor dialog" />
</div>

<p>
 Here you control the video output of the emulated Atari.
</p>
<p>
 You can select which sort of monitor to use. This option depends on
 the machine type which you have selected in the "System options"
 dialog. In ST and STE mode, you can choose between monochrome mode
 (select "Mono") and color mode (select one of the other monitor types).
 When you select "TV" and use zoomed low resolution or switch to ST
 medium, you get TV-like screen with half the intensity on every other
 line. VGA is not a valid setting in ST and STE mode, so if you select
 VGA for an ST/STE, Hatari will emulate an RGB monitor instead. Switching
 between mono and a color monitor acts like a monitor switch on a real
 ST - so beware, this will reboot your emulated system!
</p>
<p>
 In TT mode, you can only choose between TT-high resolution ("Mono")
 and normal modes (select one of the other monitor types).
 Finally the Falcon mode supports all four types of monitors. Note that most
 Falcon demos/games require a RGB or TV mode, and do not work with
 VGA, although there are also few VGA-only games and demos.
</p>
<p>
 "Show ST/STE borders" toggles the displaying of the borders around the ST /
 STE. Some demos and games use the screen borders for displaying
 additional graphics. As enabling this option increases CPU computing time,
 don't enable it if you have a very slow computer.
 Borders are shown also in Falcon emulation, but Videl emulation doesn't
 yet support palette effects.
 This option doesn't affect TT screen mode or extended VDI resolutions.
</p>
<p>
Extended VDI resolutions will emulate a sort of extended graphics card
in the emulated machine, which gives you larger (2-16 color)
resolutions for GEM. Select a resolution and color depth. Check to
activate. This mode isn't affect by the other video options mentioned
above. Uncheck to get back to a normal ST behaviour.<br />
</p>
<p><em>Note that there are several gotchas with extended VDI
resolutions:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Only GEM conformant applications work with them, 99% of all games
and demos don't.</li>
<li>GEM programs accessing screen directly (like NVDI) may crash with
large enough screen sizes.</li>
<li>Memory reserved for (larger) extended resolutions breaks TOS v3 memory
detection, so you need to interrupt boot up memory detection.</li>
<li>TOS v4 isn't compatible with them. In Falcon emulation you need to
use EmuTOS with extended resolutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Because TT and Falcon support natively larger resolutions,
VDI mode is most useful with ST / STE emulation.

<h4 class="gui">The Hatari Screen Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
  <img src="images/screen.png" width="520" height="400"
       alt="Hatari's GUI - the Hatari screen dialog" />
</div>

<p>
Here you control how the video output of the emulated Atari appears
on your screen.
</p>

<p>
 Check "Fullscreen" to run Hatari in fullscreen.  By default Hatari
 runs in windowed mode.
</p>
<p>
 The "Frame Skip" option can be used to speed up the emulator
 if it is running too slow on your system. Disable frame-skip if you have
 a fast computer. When selecting 1, 2 or 4, drawing of corresponding number
 of frames will be skipped after each frame actually shown by Hatari.
 Select "Auto" to let the emulator to decide whether, and
 how many frames will be skipped.<br />
 <em>Note:</em> The frameskip option also affects the frame rate of the
 screen animation recording!
</p>
<p>
Indicators that you can have on the Hatari window:
</p>
<ul>
<li>"Statusbar" at the bottom of the screen.
The statusbar shows the floppy drive LEDs, the current frameskip value,
the machine type including TOS version and memory size, and whether
recording is currently active.</li>
<li>"Drive led" is a colored rectangle shown on top of the Hatari window
contents. It will show any disk (floppy or hard drive) activity.</li>
<li>"None" turns both of above options off.</li>
</ul>
<p>
"Keep desktop resolution" option will use your desktop resolution
for fullscreen to avoid issues related to resolution switching,
especially on LCD monitors (they're slow).  If this isn't enabled,
values from the "Max zoomed win" option are used in selecting
a suitable resolution.
<p>
"Max zoomed win" option controls up to which size Hatari tries to scale
the Atari resolutions and how much of the borders (enabled in Atari
Monitor dialog) will be shown.  Note that there are several limitations
in this and the "Keep desktop resolution" option, partly because Hatari
has different implementations for different video modes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>VDI resolutions (selectable in Atari Monitor dialog) aren't scaled.</li>
<li>ST and STE video emulation supports only doubling of the ST-low
    resolution.</li>
<li>Hatari doesn't support downscaling. If the original Atari resolution
    is larger than the specified size (e.g. TT-high), the Hatari screen
    size will also be larger than requested.  Hatari Falcon/TT window size
    will be limited to the Desktop size though.</li>
<li>TT and Falcon resolutions support only <em>integer</em> scaling ratios.
    If the scaling ratio cannot match the requested size exactly, Hatari
    will use a ratio that will produce smaller size closest to the
    requested one.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You should set these values to a size that suits best your monitor
resolution. It is intended to help in getting Hatari to best use your
monitor space on a windowed mode and in fullscreen avoiding "fuzzy"
scaling done by your LCD monitor.
</p>
<p>
Giving "-z 2" option on command line will reset max zoomed size to
default values and "-z 1" will disable all zooming.
Note that zooming takes additional CPU computing time and should
not be enabled on very slow computers.
</p>
<p>Click the <span class="button">Screenshot</span> button to create
a screenshot in the selected format to the current working directory.
PNG and BMP formats will match the visual output of Hatari.
NEO and XIMG formats will produce Atari ST native images, but will not include
borders, or raster palette effects. NEO is limited to the 3 standard ST
resolutions.
</p>
<p>Click the <span class="button">Record&nbsp;AVI</span> button to
record an AVI format video of Hatari screen (and audio) output.
</p>
<p>
Selecting "Crop statusbar" option will leave statusbar out from
the screenshots and recorded videos.
</p>

<h4 class="gui">The Keyboard Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
  <img src="images/keyboard.png" width="460" height="384"
       alt="Hatari's GUI - the keyboard dialog" />
</div>

<p>Here you can select the keyboard mapping to use. Two different mappings
 called "Symbolic" and "Scancode" are predefined.</p>
<p>"Symbolic" tries to map the symbolic values of your PC keys
 to the ST keys. It should be working pretty good on all systems as long
 as your keyboard layout looks close to the standard English keyboard
 layout. However, you might experience some problems with special keys like
 brackets etc.</p>
<p>"Scancode" uses the scancode values of your PC keys for keyboard mapping.
 If it works on your system, this often gives better results than the symbolic
 mapping. Note that you also need a TOS version with the right language
 (e.g. use a French TOS if you are using a French keyboard).</p>
<p>You can also load a custom keyboard mapping file here if you wish. Please
 note that the custom keyboard mapping will use the "symbolic"
 mapping for all keys that are not defined by your map file. Have a look
 at the supplied example mapfile (keymap-sample.txt) to see how to create
 your own keyboard mapping.</p>
<p>
 The "Shortcuts" section can be used to configure the keyboard shortcuts
 that can be activated while the emulation is running. Hatari supports
 two sets of keyboard shortcuts: The first type is activated by pressing a
 modifier key (AltGr / right Alt by default, Cmd key on macOS) together with
 the key, and the second type is directly activated by pressing a single key,
 without additional modifier key.
 Use the arrow buttons to select the shortcut that you want to change,
 then press one of the <span class="button">Define</span> buttons to
 change the key for the shortcut. You'll be prompted to press the key
 that should be used.
 If you reconsider and don't want to change the key, you can press the
 left mouse button instead. By pressing the right mouse button during
 the prompt, you can also erase the current shortcut setting.
</p>
<p>
 The last setting in this dialog can be used to disable the key repetition
 in fast forward mode. When the emulator runs in fast forward mode, and you
 want to type text, it can be annoying that the emulated system detects
 multiple key events due to the key repetition of the emulated system.
 So this can be avoided by enabling this option.
</p>


<h4 class="gui">The Sound Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
  <img src="images/sound.png" width="400" height="400"
       alt="Hatari's GUI - the sound dialog" />
</div>

<p>Here you can control the sound subsystem.</p>
<p>Check "Enabled" if you want emulated sound at all. Emulation is faster if
sound emulation is turned off.</p>
<p>If you experiment latency issues with your OS audio's output, you
can check the "Synchronize" option to adjust Hatari's video emulation to match
your OS audio.</p>
<p>
 Nine frequencies from low to high quality are available. Experiment a
 little bit to find out which fits best for your setup.
 For most modern computers, 44100 Hz or 48000 Hz should be fine.
 For older or slower host systems, you should use a lower frequency.
 12517, 250033 and 50066 Hz are frequencies supported by
 the STE/TT/Falcon sound DMA.
</p>
<p>
YM voices volume mixing "ST table" method uses a lookup table of audio output
voltage values measured on STF, "Math model" uses a complex model to mix the
3 YM voices and "Linear" just averages the 3 YM voices. Use "ST table" or "Math model"
for accurate sound's emulation.
</p>
<p>
 You can select to record a piece of sound here.
 Use the <span class="button">Browse</span> button to choose a file.
 The file name extension that you use (.WAV or .YM) determines in which format
 the sound is recorded in. The <span class="button">Record&nbsp;sound</span> button
 is a toggle so you will need to return to the GUI to switch sound recording off
 again (or to use the keyboard shortcut for that).
</p>


<h4 class="gui">The Devices Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
  <img src="images/devices.png" width="520" height="383"
       alt="Hatari's GUI - the device dialog" />
</div>

<p>Check the first checkbox to enable printer support.
See the <a href="#Emulated_printer">Emulated printer</a> section for
details.</p>

<p>As Hatari currently only supports printing to file, click on <span
 class="button">Browse</span> to select the file to print to. You can
enter a new filename as well.</p>
<p>Check the second checkbox to enable RS232 support.
The RS232 device is configured according to the settings of
the emulated MFP RS232 of the Atari ST/STE/TT. This means Hatari will
automatically use baudrate and handshaking as configured for the
emulated machine.</p>
<p>Click on <span class="button">Browse</span> to select suitable
device files for serial input and output.  On Linux a good choice is
/dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyS1.
</p>
<p>
Check the third checkbox to enable MIDI support.
</p>
<h5>MIDI support</h5>
<p>
Hatari MIDI support can be provided either with a PortMidi library
(required on Mac / Windows), or using "raw" MIDI device files. Latter
supports also MIDI networking in games, and can be used for debug
output, while PortMidi handles only MIDI events, but makes it easier
to connect Hatari to host MIDI programs (software synthetizers etc).
</p>
<h6>"raw" MIDI device file selection</h6>
<p>
Click on <span class="button">Browse</span> to select a suitable
MIDI device files for MIDI input and output.
</p>
<p>
<span class="file">midi-linux.txt</span> file explains how to
select the correct MIDI device file, how to set up software sound
synthesizing on Linux (using ALSA and virtual MIDI devices) if your
sound card/driver doesn't support MIDI, and how to set up MIDI
networking between multiple Hatari instances, even over internet.
</p>
<div class="floatimage">
  <img src="images/devices-portmidi.png" width="520" height="114"
       alt="Hatari's GUI - PortMidi MIDI device selection" />
</div>
<h6>PortMidi MIDI device selection</h6>
<p>
Click on arrow buttons to select a suitable MIDI devices for MIDI
input and output.
</p>
<p>
PortMidi lists only MIDI devices that were active when Hatari was
started. To see ones added after that, Hatari needs to be restarted.
</p>
<p>
PS. For MIDI devices which names are not constant, but include e.g.
instance identifier at end, Hatari supports matching device by first
part of the name when there's no full match.  To use this, remove the
device identifier part from the end of the device name in saved Hatari
configuration file.  Note that using GUI Devices dialog afterwards,
will override prefix in config with a full name of a device (that
matched the prefix at that point).
</p>


<h3 class="clearboth">Keyboard shortcuts for the SDL GUI</h3>

<p>There are multiple ways to interact with the SDL GUI.</p>

<p>
TAB and cursor keys change the focus between UI elements. Home key
moves focus to the first dialog item, End key to the last one.
Initially focus is on the default UI element, but focus changes are
remembered between dialog invocations.
</p>
<p>
Enter and Space invoke the focused item, ESC key invokes the dialog
cancel option (if there is one).
</p>
<p>
UI element which name has an underlined character can be invoked
directly by pressing Alt + key with that character.  Alt + arrow keys
will act on dialog arrow buttons.
</p>

<p>Main keyboard interactions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Options GUI main view</em>: Enter accepts configuration, ESC
cancels it.</li>
<li><em>Options GUI dialogs</em>: Enter (or End + Enter if focus was moved)
returns back to main view.</li>
<li><em>Fileselector</em>: Page up and down keys move the file list by
one page, mouse wheel and Alt + cursor keys scroll it by one item.
Enter on the focused file name selects it. Enter on the OK button
accepts the selected file. ESC cancels the dialog/selection.</li>
<li><em>Alert dialogs</em>: Enter accepts and ESC cancels the dialog.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Keyboard shortcuts during emulation</h3>

<p> While the emulator is running, you can activate or toggle various
features via Hatari keyboard shortcuts. Most of them require the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltGr_key">AltGr</a> (right Alt)
modifier key. On Mac macOS, the Cmd key &#8984; is used instead.
Below are listed the default shortcut key bindings:</p>

<h3>Emulated Atari ST keyboard</h3>

<p> All other keys on the keyboard act as the normal Atari ST keys so
pressing SPACE on your PC will result in an emulated press of the SPACE
key on the ST. The following keys have special meanings: </p>

<table class="keytable">
  <thead>
    <tr class="backdropped">
      <th>Key</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="key">Alt</span></td>
      <td>will act as the ST's ALTERNATE key</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="key">left CTRL</span></td>
      <td>will act as the ST's CONTROL key</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="key">Print Screen</span></td>
      <td>will emulate the ST's HELP key</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="key">Scroll Lock</span></td>
      <td>will emulate the ST's UNDO key</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="key">Page Up</span></td>
      <td>will emulate the ST's ( key in the keypad</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="key">Page Down</span></td>
      <td>will emulate the ST's ) in the keypad</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="key">Num Lock</span></td>
      <td>Toggle cursor emulation mode in the keypad (see below)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
You can use the <span class="key">Num Lock</span> key to toggle between
normal Atari ST keypad mode and a special cursor key mode. The cursor key
mode is designed for Atari programs and games that expect the original
Atari cursor key layout (like the game &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;), i.e.
where the &quot;Insert&quot; and &quot;Clr-Home&quot; keys are right next
to the cursor keys. The <span class="key">7</span> on the keypad is then
mapped to the &quot;Insert&quot; Atari key, and the <span class="key">9</span>
key on the keypad is mapped to the &quot;Clr-Home&quot; Atari key.
The keypad numbers <span class="key">8</span>, <span class="key">4</span>,
<span class="key">5</span> and <span class="key">6</span> are mapped to the
&uarr;, &larr;, &darr; and &rarr; cursor keys on the Atari side respectively.
</p>

<p>If joystick emulation via keyboard is enabled, by default cursor keys
are used for the directions and <span class="key">right CTRL</span> key
as the fire button. Otherwise they act as corresponding keys of the emulated
Atari ST.</p>

<p>NOTE: Problems with simultaneous keypresses most likely are not an
issue in Hatari, but with the keyboard itself. Many modern keyboards
report/support only three simultaneous key presses (or even just two
depending on which keys are in question).  Expensive gaming keyboards
support more.</p>


<h3>Emulated mouse</h3>

<p>For obvious reasons your PC mouse will act as the emulated Atari ST
mouse. In fullscreen mode it will act as expected, directly controlling
the ST mouse pointer. </p>
<p>However it is a little bit different in windowed mode as
mouse cursor positions between host and emulated Atari can get
out of sync. This can be worked around by constraining the mouse
to the Hatari window. Pressing the <span class="key">AltGr+m</span>
hotkey combination or starting Hatari with the
<span class="commandline">--grab</span> command line option
grabs the mouse i.e. locks its movements to the Hatari window.
Press the shortcut key (again) to go back to normal mouse behaviour
which allows you to move mouse outside the Hatari window while
Hatari is up and running. Note: pausing the emulation will also
(temporarily) release the mouse grab.</p>
<p>Middle button click emulates double click, which is very useful
in Fast Forward mode (where normal double clicking is nearly
impossible).</p>
<p>Mouse scrollwheel will act as cursor up and down keys. </p>

<h3>Emulated joystick</h3>

<p>The Atari ST joysticks are emulated of course allowing you to play
your favourite games with Hatari. </p>
<p>The default mode is to use a connected PC joystick. You can use any
joystick that is supported by your kernel / SDL library. If your joystick works
with other applications, it will likely work with Hatari as well. Make sure
it is calibrated and then off you go. Move the stick to point into the
desired direction. Please note that Hatari will not detect analogue
movement as the Atari ST only had digital joysticks.<p>
First firebutton will act as the normal firebutton on the Atari
ST. Second firebutton will emulate either joystick up (jump), or
a keypress of the <span class="key">SPACE</span> key on the ST.
Many ST games utilize the SPACE bar for secondary game functions
(for example Xenon), and jump functionality can be useful for
platformers. Third firebutton has always autofire enabled,
regardless of the (first firebutton) autofire option.</p>
<p>If you do not have a PC joystick or joypad, then you do not need to
desperate. You can emulate one of the two Atari ST joysticks via the
cursor keys. Just activate it in the GUI. Then the cursor keys will act
as the joystick directions, the right CTRL key will act as the
firebutton. You can still use the cursor keys as the ST's
cursorkeys in this mode as long as you press <span class="key">SHIFT</span>
along with the cursorkeys.  You can also configure these keys from the
joystick options.</p>

<h3>Emulated video</h3>

<p>Hatari emulates all screen modes of the original machine.</p>
<p>
ST/STE shifter overscan effects are emulated, but due to the fact
that these effects are achieved by using quirks and glitches in the
original chips to do things beyond their specification, emulation is
a bit tricky for these effects. As a result, some demos using these
techniques might not be displayed correctly in Hatari, known ones are
listed in the <span class="file">compatibility.html</span> file.
</p>
<p>Beside that you can setup extended VDI mode. It works well only
with GEM-compliant applications, but allows using larger screen
resolutions than the standard ST ones. VDI mode is not accelerated, so
better optimized VDI implementation (e.g. NVDI) is recommended,
especially for larger screen sizes.
</p>
<p>Make sure to disable extended VDI mode for (non-GEM) games as 99%
of all ST games will not be able to make use of higher resolutions.</p>

<h3 id="Emulated_printer">Emulated printer</h3>

<p>Due to the fact that printer handling is different on Atari and
current machines, emulation of the printer is achieved by writing all
printer output to a file.</p>
<p>The file will contain a sequence of data, the same that would appear
on the data pins of the Atari ST printer port.
That would include control characters and commands for graphic
printing. Clicking "Print desktop" on the GEM desktop would result
in a messy data dump in the printer output.</p>
<p>Printer emulation works best for plain text files or programs that
do not format the output for a specific printer.
The file contents can be used with your favourite text editor for
further processing and printing to a real printer.</p>
<p>To get real direct printing out of Hatari you may set up a suitable
(e.g. PostScript) GDOS or NVDI printer driver on the emulated Atari and
set your printer device file as Hatari's printer output.<br />
<em>NOTE:</em> If the driver doesn't match or there's some other problem,
this can cause your printer to print out hundreds of pages of garbage.</p>

<h3>Emulated RS232</h3>

<p>Serial communications in Hatari is designed to directly use a serial
port on your PC.</p>
<p>Communications parameters are set automatically upon the settings of
the emulated machine. This means all you do is to set the communication
parameters like baudrate from the emulated communications software.
Hatari will do the rest and handle the serial input and output for you.</p>
<p>Note that the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; RS232 port of Hatari is the one that
is connected to the MFP chip of the selected system. This port is only
wired on the ST, STE and TT machines, but not on the Falcon. To use serial
port emulation in Falcon mode, you have to use the &ldquo;SCC channel B&rdquo;
emulation instead.</p>

<p>There're several programs that can be used with RS232 and the various ports</p>
<p>"CoNnect 95" is recommended as it supports all the ports of each machine
(ST/STE, MegaSTE, TT and Falcon). Although this program was commercial and needed
to be registered, his author released it later as freeware in 1998</p>

<p>The following table shows all the available ports (serial or lan) depending
on the machine type, as well as the corresponding options used to setup each port</p>

<h2 id="Floppy_disk_images">Floppy disk images</h2>

<p>Hatari does not use floppy disks directly but disk images due to
differences between the floppy disk controllers of the ST and the PC.
Several types of disk images are currently supported :
</p>

<ul>
<li>
the raw "ST" type
</li>
<li>
the similar "DIM" type (not widely used)
</li>
<li>
the compressed "MSA" (Magic-Shadow-Archiver) type
</li>
<li>
the "STX" type that can store low level disk layout. This format is mainly
used to dump original games with their protection. Those images are created
on a real ST using pasti.prg
</li>
<li>
the "IPF", "RAW" and "CTR" types require the caps library. Similar to STX, they
record disk layout, but at a much precise level by storing MFM data. Most of
these dumps are made with the Kryoflux board
</li>
</ul>

<p> The raw type (file suffix should be "*.st") is simply a sector by
sector image of a real floppy disk. You can easily create such an image
with the <span class="commandline">dd</span> program which should
normally be pre-installed on every
Unix-like system. Simply type something like <span class="commandline">dd
if=/dev/fd0 of=myimage.st</span> to create a disk image. Of course you
need access to
/dev/fd0, and depending on your system and the type of floppy disk you
might have to use another device name here (for example I use
/dev/fd0u720 for 720kB disks). However, if the disk is copy-protected
or
doesn't use a MSDOS compatible file system, this might fail. So be very
careful if you are not sure about the disk format. </p>
<p> The other possibility is to image the disk on a real Atari ST.
For non-protected disk, there
are programs like the Magic Shadow Archiver for this task. Hatari
supports this slightly compressed MSA disk images, too. Note that
Hatari
only supports the "old" MSA format, there are some Magic Shadow
Archiver
clones (like Jay-MSA) that create better compressed but
Hatari-incompatible disk images. However, if you have got such a MSA
disk and want to use it with Hatari, you can still run the
corresponding
MSA program within Hatari to extract the incompatible disk image to a
normal floppy disk image.
<p>
For protected disk, the most widely used method is to run pasti.prg on
a real Atari ST and get a .STX image.
<br/>
For more complex protections or altered disk, one can use *.IPF or *.CTR
which include tools to check MFM data and possible problems when dumping a disk.
</p>
<p> While *.ST, *.MSA and *.STX are more or less the "standard" types of Atari
disk images, you might sometimes also find STT or ADF images on the
internet. These currently do not work with Hatari. </p>
<p>Hatari can now also utilize *.DIM images just as *.ST ones without
any problems.
Note that DIM images are nearly the same as the raw ST images
(they only have an additional 32 bytes header), so you can easily
transform
the DIM images into ST images by stripping the header from the files.
For example try something like:
<span class="commandline">dd if=input.dim of=output.st bs=32 skip=1</span>
</p>
<p> If you have got a disk image that has been created with the old ST
emulator PaCifiST (for DOS) or with early versions of the program
Makedisk, and the disk image does not work with Hatari, then the disk
probably suffers from the "PaCifiST bootsector bug" (Hatari will
display a
warning message then). In this case, the bootsector of the disk
contains some illegal data, so that the disk even does not work on a
real ST any more. However, if it is a .ST and not a .MSA disk, you can
easily fix it by using a hex-editor to change the byte at offset $D
(13)
from 0 to 1 (don't forget to backup your disk image first, since you
can also easily destroy your disk image when changing a wrong byte
there). If the disk contains a bootsector program, you probably have to
adjust the boot sector check sum, too (it can be found at offset $1FE +
$1FF). </p>
<p>Hatari supports disk images that are compressed with (Pk-)ZIP
(file suffix must be ".zip") or GZip (file suffix must be ".st.gz" or
".msa.gz"), so you can archive your disk images into zip archives.
You can also directly run the zip archives you may download from the
net as long as the archive contains a disk image in .ST or .MSA format.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Hatari does not save disk images back to *.ZIP files
so
your highscores and savegames are lost if you load the game from such
a zipped disk image.</p>


<h3>Floppy formatting</h3>

<p>
Low level floppy formatting uses write track FDC command.  Because
simpler floppy image formats like ST / MSA don't have such low level
information, they can't be low level formatted. For empty ST floppy
images, one can use "create blank disk" in Hatari options "Floppy
disks" dialog (see "The Floppy Disks Dialog" section).
</p>
<p>
<em>Hatari supports low level track writes (and formatting) only for
the STX format</em>. Hatari implements that by doing all track writes
to a separate *.wd1172 overlay file. To test it, copy some .STX file
for example to "empty.stx". Format it from desktop, or use a separate
formatting program like Fastcopy. This should create an additional
"empty.wd1172" file.
</p>
<p>
(Note: IPF format itself is complete enough, but capslibrary doesn't
yet have the required write support.)
</p>


<h2>Hard disk support</h2>

<p>
Hatari supports three ways of emulating Atari hard drives: The
low-level ACSI and IDE hard drive emulation and a GEMDOS based HD
emulation. In most cases the GEMDOS HD emulation is best as it allows
exchanging files easily between the emulated and the host environment.
</p>
<p>
Please note that changing the HD-image or the GEMDOS HD-folder will reset
the emulated Atari since it is not possible to switch the hard drive
while the emulator is running.
</p>
<p>
On a 32-bit host system, the size of a hard disk image is limited to 2 GB.
On 64-bit host systems, bigger images might be possible but the support
for bigger images is not tested very well yet.
</p>
<p>
The maximum size of partitions inside the hard disk (images) depends on the
TOS version. TOS 1.00 and 1.02 support up to 256 MiB, TOS 1.04 to 3.06 up to
512 MiB and TOS 4.0x supports up to 1 GB partitions.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: you need to be careful when mounting device files.  Depending on
the system setup (e.g. udev settings) partitions on memory cards etc.
can be mounted automatically. When Hatari is started and uses a device
file with partitions that are already mounted, data can be destroyed
(when several programs independently write to the same device).
Disable your desktop automount, or remember to manually unmount
devices before giving them to Hatari.
</p>


<h3>GEMDOS based hard drive emulation</h3>
<p>
With GEMDOS HD emulation, you can easily "mount" a folder from the
host file system to a drive of the emulated Atari.
</p>
<p>
If you provide Hatari a directory containing only single letter (C-Z)
subdirectories, each of these subdirectories will be treated as a
separate partition, otherwise the given directory itself will be
assigned to drive "C:". In the multiple partition case, the letters
used as the subdirectory names will determine to which
drives/partitions they're assigned.  For example following
directory setup:
</p>
<pre>
partitions/
  + C/
  + D/
</pre>
<p>
That is given to Hatari as "hatari -d partitions", will give you
GEMDOS HD emulated C: and D: drives.
</p>
<p>
GEMDOS HD emulation is an easy way to share files between the
host system and the emulated Atari, but there are also several
<strong>limitations</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Directory entries are returned in a (case-insensitively) sorted
order, for consistency.  E.g. moving files to a different directory and
back (without changing their names) like AUTOSORT does, doesn't change
that order. You need to rename the files.</li>
<li>Names which aren't valid TOS directory or file names, are converted
to a valid format.  If there are multiple files which converted
names are identical in TOS-format, you see only one of those.</li>
<li>Host file paths need to be shorter than 256 characters currently
(like Atari side TOS file paths).</li>
<li>It is not possible to use a cartridge image at the same time
with GEMDOS HD emulation (Hatari has its own cartridge code
that is used for GEMDOS HD emulation).</li>
<li>Anything that installs its own GEMDOS handler, like MiNT, does not work
with GEMDOS HD emulation. Such things need to be run from a real hard disk
image, or in case of MiNT, use OLDTOSFS for GEMDOS HD access.</li>
<li>GEMDOS HD file handles start from index 64.  If programs have more
files open on <i>non-GEMDOS HD drives</i>, i.e. their indexes increase
over 64, accesses to those indexes could get routed (incorrectly) to
GEMDOS HD drive instead</li>
<li>GEMDOS HD supports up to 64 file handles (TOS supports slightly more).</li>
<li>GEMDOS HD drive assignment can conflict with the ACSI and IDE hard
drives. If you want to use GEMDOS HD directory and ACSI/IDE disk
images together, either use the GEMDOS HD option for skipping ACSI
&amp; IDE partitions, or use a multiple partition GEMDOS HD emulation
setup and select the partition subdirectory names (see above) so that
they do not conflict with the drive letters for ACSI/IDE partitions.
With HD Driver you have also another option,
see <a href="#Using_HD_Driver_with_GEMDOS_partitions">Using HD Driver
with GEMDOS HD partitions</a>.</li>
<li><em>The GEMDOS HD emulation does not work (very well) with TOS
1.00 and 1.02</em>.  Use at least TOS 1.04 if you want the GEMDOS HD
emulation to work properly.</li>
<li>Ddelete() directory removal works <em>only</em> for directories which
have no files.</li>
<li>Fforce() file handle redirection works <em>only</em> for standard
handles used with GEMDOS <em>file</em> functions, such as Fwrite() to standard
output that is redirected to a file.  File redirection is NOT supported
e.g. for GEMDOS Ccon* console functions.</li>
<li>Host and emulation have their own clocks, which will drift apart
after emulation is started, especially when emulation is
fast-forwarded or paused.  Because of this, anything inside emulation
that relies on file timestamps (e.g. build utilities) may not work as
expected if you modify the files on the host after emulation is
already running.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If your programs complain that they could not find/read/write
files on the GEMDOS emulated drive, you can copy and use them
from a floppy disk image or a real hard disk image instead.
</p>


<h3>ACSI &amp; IDE hard drive emulation with EmuTOS</h3>

<p>
Accessing HD image files is easiest with EmuTOS.  It supports both
ASCI and IDE interfaces, regardless of emulated machine type, and
understands DOS partition tables without additional drivers.
<span class="commandline">atari-hd-image.sh</span> script coming
with Hatari can be used to create such image files and to copy
initial data to them.
</p>
<p>
If you have an hard drive (image) with Atari format partition table,
that should already have hard disk driver on it and work fine. Only
partitioning/formatting them is the problem.  Creating such images
from scratch is described in following sections.
</p>
<p>
Note that while EmuTOS supports Atari format partition tables, and
could access also hard disks with them, it doesn't run hard disk
driver installed to the drive.  For such drives, it may be better to
use a suitable Atari TOS version.
</p>


<h3 id="ACSI_hard_drive_emulation">ACSI hard drive emulation</h3>
<p>
To use the ACSI hard drive emulation, you need a hard disk image file
with a pre-installed HD driver in it. You can try to get an image of
your old ST hard disk or grab one from the internet (e.g. from the
Hatari website).
Please note that the size of ACSI hard drive is normally limited to 1 GB
due to some addressing constraints of the ACSI bus. Bigger disks were only
possible with certain host adapters &ndash; this behaviour is emulated by
Hatari, too, but you need a hard disk driver that supports these extensions.
</p>
<p>
To create a <em>new</em> ACSI hard disk image, you can start with an empty
image that you have created for example with the following command:
<span class="commandline">dd if=/dev/zero of=hd.img bs=512 count=xxx</span>
(where 'xxx' is size in 512 byte blocks).  Copy the complete AHDI 5.0
package to a floppy disk image, then boot Hatari with this floppy disk
image and the fresh hard disk image like this:
<span class="commandline">--acsi hd.img ahdi.st</span>.
Then start HDX.PRG from the floppy disk and format + partition the hard
disk image with it.
</p>
<p>
Formatting and partitioning works currently only with AHDI 5, but you
can install the AHDI 6 driver to the hard disk after it is formatted.
Restart the emulated system, run AHDI.PRG from the floppy disk to access
the hard disk image from the emulated Atari and then run HINSTALL.PRG.
After installing the hard disk driver to the fresh HD image with
HINSTALL.PRG, you can boot directly from the hard disk image.
</p>
<p>
HD Driver (v9) partitioning is also compatible with Hatari ACSI
emulation. CBHD and ICDPro AdSCSI drivers work on images which have
been partitioned elsewhere.
</p>


<h3>IDE hard drive emulation</h3>
<p>
As the IDE disk format (little endian) differs from the ACSI disk format
(big endian), you need separate disk images for them.  Hatari doesn't
currently support partitioning IDE disks with AHDI, but you can do it with
<em>C&eacute;cile</em>.
</p>
<p>
First create an empty image file with the size of your choice with:
<span class="commandline">dd if=/dev/zero of=hd.img bs=1k count=xxx</span>.
Then get the C&eacute;cile hard disk driver from
<a href="http://centek.free.fr/atari/softs/s_cecile.htm">http://centek.free.fr/atari/softs/s_cecile.htm</a>
and put it on a floppy disk image (e.g. to one named "cecile.st" using:
<span class="commandline">zip2st.sh cecile.zip</span>).
</p>
<p>
Run Hatari with
<span class="commandline">hatari --machine falcon --tos tos404.rom
--ide-master hd.img cecile.st</span>, switch to larger color resolution
and warm up your French language skills. Then start the C&eacute;cile hard
disk driver CECILE.PRG and run CC_TOOLS.APP to partition your hard
disk image. Click the "Partition" button, select "Hatari IDE disk" and set
suitable partition size with the arrows (below type field). Then click
"Valider".
</p>
<p>
If you only want to use your HD image in Falcon mode, you can install
the C&eacute;cile hard disk driver to the image from the C&eacute;cile
CC_TOOLS.APP: Click the "Installer" button and save the C&eacute;cile driver
to the 1st partition on "Hatari IDE disk". If you want to also use your HD
image in ST/STE mode, you need to get and install either HD Driver or
AHDI 6 driver on it instead (see <a href="#ACSI_hard_drive_emulation">ASCI
hard drive emulation</a> section).
</p>
<p>
Then you can boot from your hard disk image by simply specifying it
with the <span class="commandline">--ide-master</span> parameter.
</p>


<h2>Moving files to/from hard disk images</h2>

<p>Moving files to and from Atari hard disk images can be done
either through GEMDOS HD partitions (host directories mounted inside
Hatari emulation) or accessing the images directly on the host
(outside the emulation).  Both have their own limitations.</p>

<p>If it is fine for the IDE/ACSI partitions to be first, you can
either use ACSI/IDE partition skip option, or a multipartition GEMDOS
HD setup as described in above sections.
</p>

<p>If you want to boot from a GEMDOS HD partition i.e. such to be
before hard disk image partitions, and still to be able to access all
the IDE/ACSI partitions, you need to use HD Driver.  Note: this is the
preferred method with EmuTOS (v0.9.x), because it doesn't run/use
driver installed to the IDE/ACSI image directly and has some limitations
in its partition table/type support.</p>

<h3 id="Using_HD_Driver_with_GEMDOS_partitions">Using HD Driver with GEMDOS partitions</h3>

<p>Uwe Seimet's <a href="https://www.hddriver.net/">HD Driver</a> works
fine with both the Hatari GEMDOS HD partitions and normal hard disk images.
</p>

<p>First copy the HDDRIVER.PRG binary into your GEMDOS HD emulation
directory AUTO folder. Then start the HDDRUTIL.APP configuration utility,
locate HDDRIVER.PRG, open the
<a href="https://www.hddriver.net/en/screenshots.html">"Devices
and Partitions" dialog</a> and select the "Preserve Existing Partitions"
option.  Then you can just start Hatari with your hard disk image and
this GEMDOS HD directory, for example like this:
"<span class="commandline">hatari --harddrive gemdos-hd/ --ide-master
ide-hd.image</span>".</p>

<p>If you're using
the <a href="https://www.hddriver.net/en/demo.html">demo version
of HD Driver</a>, you can write files only to the C: partition, i.e. in
above case only copy files from the hard disk image partition to the
GEMDOS HD partition (with some write slowdowns included into the demo
version). If you want to copy files to the hard disk image with
the <em>demo</em> version of the HD Driver, you need to set the hard disk
image as drive C:.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, set the GEMDOS HD partitions to be from D: forward,
i.e. have a directory which contains only single letter subdirectories,
starting from "D" like in "<span class="commandline">mkdir gemdos-hd;
mkdir gemdos-hd/D</span>". Then give Hatari (as the last parameter)
a boot floppy image containing the demo version of HDDRIVER.PRG in
its AUTO folder, like this: "<span class="commandline">hatari
--ide-master ide-hd.image --harddrive gemdos-hd/ hd-driver-floppy.st</span>".
You can convert HD Driver ZIP package to floppy image with the
<span class="commandline">zip2st</span> utility.</p>


<h3>Accessing HDD image partitions outside of Hatari</h3>

<p>
If you want to access the hard disk image partitions also outside
the emulation, the disk image needs to have a DOS partition table.
The <span class="commandline">atari-hd-image</span> script included
with Hatari can be used to create such an image.
</p>
<p>
Inside the Hatari emulator, EmuTOS can access partition(s) on these
kind of images directly without any driver software.  Of the Atari HD
drivers mentioned above, Centek's C&eacute;cile and Uwe Seimet's HD Driver
(demo) work fine with these partitions. E.g. AHDI and CBHD don't.
C&eacute;cile works only with TT or Falcon.
</p>
<p>
To summarise; if EmuTOS is enough, use that. Otherwise, if you want to
use TT or Falcon emulation, use C&eacute;cile (or full HD Driver version if
you have it), otherwise use HD Driver (demo).
</p>
<p>
To access the content of the partitions on Linux host, there are two
possibilities:

<h4>Using Mtools</h4>
<p>
For this you need to add an entry for the hard disk
image to your <span class="commandline">~/.mtoolsrc</span> and
specify which partition you want to access from the image. For
an image created with the above mentioned script, the line in
the configuration file should look something like this:
</p>
<pre>
MTOOLS_NO_VFAT=1
drive c: file="/home/user/hatari/hd.img" partition=1
</pre>
<p>
Note that Mtools is instructed to use FAT compatibility mode because
EmuTOS cannot deal properly with VFAT file information.  If you don't
want this setting for all your Mtools drives, you can set it also via
the environment like this ("::" refers to the drive image given with
the "-i" option):
</p>
<pre>
MTOOLS_NO_VFAT=1 mcopy -spmv -i hd.img files/* ::
</pre>

<h4>Using a loopback device</h4>
<p>
This is recommended even by Mtools documentation, but it is less convenient
as it requires root rights. First you need to "loop" mount the image:
</p>
<pre>
$ su
# image="hd.img"; mountdir="hd"
# start=$(parted $image unit s print | awk '/ 1 /{print $2}' | tr -d s)
# losetup -f $image -o $((512*$start))
# loop=$(losetup -a | grep $image | cut -d: -f1)
# mkdir -p $mountdir
# mount -t msdos $loop $mountdir
</pre>
<p>
This uses <span class="commandline">parted</span> to find out the first
partition offset in sectors and then tells <span class="commandline">losetup</span>
to bind the first free loop device to a corresponding offset from
the <span class="commandline">hd.img</span> image.
<span class="commandline">mount</span> is then used to mount the file system
from the loop device on top of the "hd" directory.
</p>
<p>
After you have copied the relevant files to the "hd" directory, you need
to unmount the file system and remove the loop device binding before
using the disk image from Hatari:
</p>
<pre>
# umount $mountdir
# losetup -d $loop
</pre>


<h2 id="Performance">Performance</h2>

<p>Hatari performance varies between Atari programs, depending on what
features Hatari needs to emulate for them.  Less accurate Atari
emulators may be faster as emulation accuracy has a performance
overhead.</p>

<p>The operating system and libraries below Hatari can also sometimes
have a noticeable effect on performance.</p>

<p>
Hatari can be sped up considerably by giving up some emulation or
emulator accuracy.  With ST/STe emulation, these options should be
needed only on slow devices, typically ARM and/or mobile ones (e.g.
Raspberry Pi).
</p>


<h3>Operating system components performance</h3>

<p>
Finding out whether there's a performance problem with the system
components (like SDL) in your setup, requires profiling Hatari and
rest of the system. How to do that is OS specific. On Linux that would
involve running "perf record -a" command (as root) on the background
for few minutes while Hatari is running, and then investigating
the results with "perf report" command.
</p>

<p>
Some other process eating CPU cycles from Hatari one can see just with
the (Linux/Unix) "top" command.
</p>


<h3>Build options impact on performance</h3>

<p>
<em>Compiler</em>: Unless you have disabled compiler optimizations
(like GCC's -O2 or -O3 options) in the Hatari build, the extra
optimization flags (like GCC's "-mtune=i686") don't seem to have very
large effect on Hatari performance.  Using GCC -O3 option instead of
-O2 can give minor (5-10%) performance improvements for things (mainly
demos) that use very heavily interrupts.
</p>

<p>
<em>Older versions</em>: If nothing else helps, try (building) much
earlier Hatari version.  More accurate emulation in newer Hatari
versions means that they can be slower despite optimizations.
</p>


<h3>Run-time emulation options</h3>

<p>
Emulation options have the largest impact on Hatari performance. These
options can be changed from the Hatari GUI System and CPU dialogs and
the emulation needs to be rebooted for any of these changes to take an
effect!  They are enabled by default.
</p>

<h4>DSP (Falcon)</h4>

<p>
Emulating the Falcon DSP is performance-wise several times more demanding
than emulating the m68k; DSP runs at higher frequency, executes many
instructions for each m68k instruction and emulation isn't as mature
and optimized.  Unless some Falcon program needs DSP, <em>none</em> or
<em>dummy</em> DSP emulation mode could be used.  Even of the programs
that do use DSP, many use it only for background music and work
fine without the real DSP emulation.
</p>

<h4>CPU: cycle exact (030/TT/Falcon)</h4>

<p>
CPU core supports 030 cache emulation for cycle accuracy. This
is very heavy.  Unless program needs cycle accuracy to work correctly,
you can disable it.  Many Falcon demos need it, applications and games
normally don't.
</p>

<h4>Timer-D</h4>
<p>
With ST/STe, the single largest factor contributing to general Hatari
emulation performance is the handling of interrupts.  Enabling Timer-D
patching option greatly improves Hatari ST/STE emulation performance
as it significantly reduces the number of interrupts generated by the
emulated Atari machine. Using this has adverse effect only for very
rare programs.
</p>

<h4>FDC</h4>
<p>
While accurate FDC emulation doesn't take that much CPU, it slows down
floppy image accesses (and Hatari startup) a lot.  Only <em>very</em>
few demos and games require accurate FDC emulation for their copy
protection, so enabling fast floppy access is fairly safe.
</p>

<h4>CPU: prefetch</h4>
<p>
After the DSP, cycle accuracy and interrupts, m68k emulation takes
most time. Disabling the "Prefetch" / "Compatible" option can speed up
the emulation noticeably, but it will be less accurate.  This can be
fine for many games and other programs, but won't work e.g. for demos
using overscan or rasters. This is recommended only as a last resort.
</p>

<p>
Roughly speaking, for Falcon DSP emulation with cycle exact 030 cache
emulation, one needs <em>at least</em> 3Ghz machine. For normal (unpatched)
Timer-D frequency on some specific cases (like demos with overscan 512
color animations) one may need over 1GHz machine for ST/STE emulation,
but some rare demos may require over 1GHz machine even with Timer-D
patching.
</p>

<p>
<strong>NOTE</strong>: Above options may cause some programs to work incorrectly.
The <a href="compatibility.html">Hatari Software Compatibility List</a>
lists programs known to need real Falcon DSP emulation, Timer-D
frequency or accurate FDC timings.
</p>


<h3>Emulator options</h3>

<p>
Emulator options don't usually have as large effect on performance as
emulation options, but they don't affect the emulated programs at all,
just the quality of the emulation "output". These options can also
be toggled at run-time without rebooting the emulation.
</p>

<h4>Sound</h4>

<p>
Internal Hatari sound handling and the SDL_mixer sound thread
libALSA sound processing can account up to 1/3 of the Hatari CPU usage
in normal ST/STE emulation. Disabling sound will get rid of that.
Using low sound frequency or one matching your sound card may also help.
Best is if you disable also background music from the programs you run
in Hatari as this can significantly reduce the number of generated
interrupts.
</p>

<p>
If program supports both ST and STE, use STE. Emulating DMA sound, is
more lightweight than interrupt heavy ST sound.
</p>

<p>
If problem is occasional performance related audio glitches, increasing
the sound buffer size (with "--sound-buffer-size" option) may help, but
it increases sound latency.
</p>

<h4>Frame skipping</h4>

<p>
Screen rendering can take noticeable amount of CPU time. The default
Hatari "auto" frame skipping should be used unless there's a good
reason not to.  It will skip converting and showing some of the frames
if there's not enough time for them.
</p>

<p>
Also, if your monitor refresh frequency is lower than the selected
Hatari monitor frequency (e.g. LCD monitors usually use 60Hz whereas
Atari monochrome monitor uses 71Hz), you should use frameskip of one.
The reason is that if your SDL library uses VSync to synchronize the
output to screen, with zero frame skip that forces the emulation to
run slower than a real Atari. If SDL doesn't use VSync, Hatari does
redundant work to convert frames you can't see.
</p>

<h4>Zooming</h4>
<p>
If you are not using frame skip, disabling zooming can have
noticeable improvement on performance.  You can do this by specifying
suitably low "Max zoomed" resolution (<span class="commandline">--zoom
1</span> command line option sets it to 320x200 for ST-low resolution).
If you still want to have a nice fullscreen mode, you should rather
add the right resolution mode-lines (e.g. "320x200") to your xorg.conf
file.  If you still want to use zooming, disabling borders may help a
bit.
</p>

<h4>Spec512 color handling</h4>
<p>
Handling Spec512 color modes which change the ST/e palette constantly
takes some extra CPU.  If you have problems with CPU usage in such
screens and you care more e.g. from the sound quality than visuals, you
can either increase the threshold or disable the Spec512 mode handling
completely by zeroing the threshold for that with the
<span class="commandline">--spec512 0</span> option.
</p>

<h4>Statusbar and drive LED</h4>
<p>
If your version of the SDL library uses VSync to synchronize the screen
output, drawing of the statusbar or the drive LED may have some minor
impact on performance too.  Normally they shouldn't.
</p>


<h3>Measuring the performance</h3>

<p>
There are a couple of ways to monitor and measure Hatari performance.
</p>
<p>
By default Hatari has Statusbar visible and automatic frameskip
enabled. When Hatari has enough time that it can sleep a little each
frame, the statusbar frame skip ("FS") value keeps at zero.  If Hatari
is completely busy, it will increase to the maximum specified
(automatic) frame skip value.
</p>
<p>
Hatari has also a facility to measure FPS i.e. Frames Per Second.
Enable frame skipping with
<span class="commandline">--fast-forward yes</span> option
(or use the corresponding keyboard shortcut) and set
<span class="commandline">--log-level info</span>.
Then after a while, press the "Pause" key.  Whenever Hatari emulation
is paused, Hatari will output on console info on how many VBLs it
could show per second, along with some other numbers.
</p>
<p>
It depends on what you want to measure, but usually it is best to
disable sound and set high frame skip like
<span class="commandline">--sound off --frameskips 60</span> so that
the associated external overheads are minimized.  E.g. video output
can on some platforms do VSync and measurements would then show your
monitor refresh frequency instead of the actual Hatari performance.
</p>
<p>
On Unix systems with <span class="commandline">times()</span> function
call, only the time spent by the Hatari process itself is measured.
On other systems, much less accurate SDL "wall clock" timings are
used.  To make latter more accurate you could use also
<span class="commandline">--run-vbls</span> option to specify how many
VBLs Hatari should run before it exits.  In this case it is best to
either have the test-case run automatically from the AUTO-folder or
given as memory snapshot to Hatari with the frame skip set equal to
the VBL count.
</p>
<p>
Note that these numbers can fluctuate quite a bit, <em>especially</em>
when the SDL timings are used, so for (statistically) reliable numbers
you may need to repeat the measurement several times.  You should of
course make also sure that the system doesn't have any other activity
at the same time you are making the measurements.

<h3>Introduction to Emulation</h3>

<p>Emulation via software is an art and Hatari is an example of this.</p>
<p>Emulation is to make a computer behave like a (probably) completely
different machine on the lowest possible level.
This includes CPU and custom chip emulation allowing software written
for the emulated machine to be run without it noticing a difference.
</p>
<p>
The key to emulation is to simply do those things with a software
program, the emulator, that normally chips would perform.
So you have an CPU emulator that basically consists of a large loop
that does exactly what the real thing would do:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>fetch an instruction from virtual memory</li>
  <li>interpret this instruction</li>
  <li>fetch operands from the emulated registers and memory</li>
  <li>perform the operation like addition or changing the program
counter on a jump instruction</li>
  <li>writes results back into the intended registers or memory
locations</li>
  <li>increment of the program counter and loop</li>
</ul>
<p>
The typical von-Neumann CPU can be emulated very fast, stable and
error-free using such a simple loop system.
</p>
<p>
But in most cases the CPU emulation is the simplest part. Correct
emulation of the various custom chips and hardware parts of the
emulated system, and their proper synchronization, is much trickier.
