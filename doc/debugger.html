<h2 id="The_debugger">The debugger</h2>

<p>
Hatari has a built-in debugging interface which can be used for
analyzing code that runs in the emulated system.
</p>

<p>
On Unix (Linux / macOS) debugger uses Hatari's parent console window, so
make sure you run Hatari from the command line when you want to use
the debugger.  On Windows you need to use "-W" option to get console
window.  You can add an icon to your desktop that does it.  On Linux
it should do something like this (replace "xterm" with your favorite
terminal program):
</p>
<pre>
xterm -T "Hatari debug window" -e hatari
</pre>

<p>
To run debugger commands from a file at Hatari startup, one can use
the "--parse &lt;file&gt;" command line option.  This is useful e.g.
for debugging TOS or some demo startup code, or if you always want to
use some specific debugger setup (breakpoints etc).
</p>

<p>
Note that when debugger scripts are run, current directory is set to
the currently running script's directory i.e. all file operations are
relative to it.  After script finishes, earlier current directory is
restored.  To set current directory from a setup script, e.g. for
scripts run at breakpoints, you need to give '-f' option for the
'cd' command.
</p>


<h3>Invoking the debugger</h3>

<p>
You can invoke the debugger manually by pressing the
<span class="key">AltGr + Pause</span> key combination.
</p>

<p>
With the "-D" command line option, you can toggle whether m68k
exceptions will also invoke the debugger.  Which exceptions cause
this, can be controlled with the "--debug-except" option.
</p>

<p>
Giving "-D" option at Hatari startup is not advised because TOS HW
checks generate some exceptions at every TOS boot.  It is better to
toggle exception catching later from the debugger with the "setopt -D"
command.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can give "--debug-except" option "autostart" flag
(e.g. "--debug-except all,autostart").  This will enable catching of
(specified) exceptions after TOS boot, when Atari program given on
Hatari command line is <em>autostarted</em>.
</p>


<h3>Debugger configuration options</h3>

<p>When you save Hatari configuration, your current debugger
settings are also saved to the Hatari configuration file.
These are their defaults:</p>
<pre>
[Debugger]
nNumberBase = 10
nSymbolLines = -1
nMemdumpLines = -1
nDisasmLines = -1
nBacktraceLines = 0
nExceptionDebugMask = 515
nDisasmOptions = 15
bDisasmUAE = TRUE
bSymbolsAutoLoad = TRUE
bMatchAllSymbols = FALSE
</pre>

<p>Settings are following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>nNumberBase</dt>
<dd>Debugger number base.
    Set with the debugger "setopt [bin|dec|hex]" command</dd>
<dt>nSymbolLines</dt>
<dd>Number of lines to show when listing debug symbols</dd>
<dt>nMemdumpLines</dt>
<dd>Number of memory dump lines to show</dd>
<dt>nDisasmLines</dt>
<dd>Number of disassembly lines to show</dd>
<dt>nBacktraceLines</dt>
<dd>Number of items to show in stack/bactraces</dd>
<dt>nExceptionDebugMask</dt>
<dd>Mask of exceptions which invoke debugger when exceptions catching
    is enabled (-D).  Set with the "--debug-except" option</dd>
<dt>nDisasmOptions</dt>
<dd>External disassembler output options, set with the "--disasm" option</dd>
<dt>bDisasmUAE</dt>
<dd>Whether disassembly uses CPU core internal disassembler ("uae"),
    or the external disassembler ("ext" one with output options).
    Set with the "--disasm" option</dd>
<dt>bSymbolsAutoLoad</dt>
<dd>Whether debug symbols are automatically loaded when debugger is invoked,
    and freed when program exits, for Atari programs run though GEMDOS HD.
    Set with the "symbols autoload [on|off]" command
    </dd>
<dt>bMatchAllSymbols</dt>
<dd>Whether symbol name TAB-completion matches just symbols from
    a relevant code section, or all of them.  Toggled with the
    "symbols match" command</dd>
</dl>

<p>Settings on how many lines are shown can be changed only from the
configuration file. You should need to change/set them only if you've
built debugger without readline support, as it can't then determine
terminal size ("-1" = use terminal height).</p>

<p>Note that "--debug-except" and "--disasm" options can be given either
on Hatari command line or, like all other Hatari command line options,
with the debugger "setopt" command.</p>

</pre>


<h4 id="Entering_arguments_to_debugger_commands">Entering arguments to debugger commands</h4>

<p>
After writing (with TAB completion) one of the above command names,
pressing TAB will (for most commands) show all the available subcommands.
</p>

<p>
If you want to give numbers in other number bases
than the default/selected one, they need to be prefixed with a
character indicating this.  For decimals this prefix is "#" (#15),
for hexadecimals "$" ($F), and for binary values it is "%" (%1111).
</p>

<p>
By default debugger expects all numbers without a prefix to be
decimals, but you can change the default number base with the "setopt"
command, just give it the desired default number base (bin/dec/hex).
<em>When using the hexadecimal number base, remember still to prefix
hexadecimal numbers with '$' if they could be confused with register
names (a0-7, d0-7)!</em>  Otherwise results from expressions and
conditional breakpoints can be unexpected.
</p>


<h4>Calculations and immediate evaluation</h4>

<p>
Instead of a number, you can also use an arithmetic expression, by
surrounding it with quotes ("").  An expression can contain
calculations with CPU and DSP registers, symbols and Hatari variables
in addition to numbers. For example to give a sum of A0 and D0
register values to a command, use "a0+d0".
</p>

<p>
Also within arithmetic expressions, parenthesis are used to indicate
indirect addressing, <em>not</em> to change the order of precedence.
Unlike with conditional breakpoint expressions (explained below), you
cannot give size for the indirect addressing, a long value is always
read from the RAM address given within parenthesis.  For example to
get a long value pointed by stack pointer + 2, use "(a7+2)".
</p>

<p>
Values of arithmetic expressions are always evaluated before being
given to a command.  Except for "evaluate" and "address" commands,
they always need to be marked with quotes (""). Besides arithmetic,
this can be used also to give symbol/register/variable values to
commands that don't otherwise interpret them.  If command complains
that it didn't recognize e.g. a register name, just put it to quotes
and it will be "evaluated" before being given to the command.
</p>

<p>
Virtual V0-V7 "registers" can be used to store intermediate results
for calculations. For example, to get a sum of "_counter" symbol
address contents one could use following in suitable breakpoint:
</p>
<pre>
# store counter sum to V0 virtual register
r v0=(_counter)
# store count of how many values are added
r v1="v1+1"
</pre>
<p>And then later on, calculate the average:</p>
<pre>
# round the counter sum (add half count to sum)
r v2="v0 + v1/2"
# and calculate the rounded average (rounded sum / count)
e v2/v1
</pre>
<p>(Another virtual register was used for rounding here, in case one
wants to continue summing the _counter values with the original
value.)
</p>

<p>
With command argument completion (see <a href="#readline">readline</a>),
result from the last "evaluate" command can be inserted by typing '$'
and pressing TAB.
</p>


<h4>Hatari outputs and their controls</h4>

<p>When debugging something, there can be so much output that you
want to store emulator output for more detailed inspection later.</p>

<p>Hatari has 5 different kinds of outputs and their controls:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#Tracing">Tracing</a>, controlled by "--trace" and
    "--trace-file" options</li>
<li>Logging, controlled by "--log-level" and "--log-file" options</li>
<li>Debugger CPU+DSP <a href="Inspecting_emulation_state">disassembly /
    memdump / register</a> commands output, controlled by "logfile" command</li>
<li>Xconout redirection [1] + Hatari command line help,
    hard-coded to "stdout"</li>
<li>Rest of debugger (breakpoints etc) + Hatari output,
    hard-coded to "stderr"</li>
</ul>

<p>With 3 first options defaulting to "stderr".</p>

<p>If you want to catch all of them, it is better just to redirect
all "stdout" and "stderr" output from Hatari to a file:</p>
<pre>
hatari --parse debugger.ini --trace os_base 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee out.log
</pre>

<p>("2&gt;&amp;1" redirects stderr to stdout for piping, and tee"
command both saves and shows the output, so that you can still see
the saved output in more or less real-time.)</p>

<p>[1] E.g. VT52 console redirection to Hatari standard output is enabled
with "os_base" and "os_all" trace settings and "--conout 2" option.</p>


<h3 id="Inspecting_emulation_state">Inspecting emulation state</h3>

<p>
In the beginning, probably the most interesting commands are "m" and "d"
for dumping and disassembling memory regions.  You can use "dm" and "dd"
commands to do the same for the DSP.
</p>
<pre>
&gt; help memdump
'memdump' or 'm' - dump memory
Usage:  m [b|w|l] [start address-[end address| count]]
	dump memory at address or continue dump from previous address.
	By default memory output is done as bytes, with 'w' or 'l'
	option, it will be done as words/longs instead.  Output amount
	can be given either as a count or an address range.
</pre>
<pre>
&gt; help disasm
'disasm' or 'd' - disassemble from PC, or given address
Usage:  d [start address-[end address]]
        If no address is given, this command disassembles from the last
        position or from current PC if no last position is available.
</pre>
<pre>
&gt; disasm pc
$00aa6e : 2f08                                 move.l    a0,-(sp)
$00aa70 : 0241 0fff                            andi.w    #$fff,d1
$00aa74 : 207c 00fe 78c0                       movea.l   #$fe78c0,a0
$00aa7a : 2070 1000                            movea.l   (a0,d1.w),a0
$00aa7e : 4ed0                                 jmp       (a0)
</pre>

<p>
Both commands accept in addition to numeric addresses also register
and symbol names, like in above example.  If you don't specify an
address, the commands continue showing from an address that comes
after the previously shown data.  "disasm" command default address
will be reset to PC address every time you re-enter the debugger.
</p>

<p>
Use "setopt --disasm help" if you want to set options controlling
the disassembly output.
</p>

<p>
You can use the "info" command to see state of specific sets of HW
registers (e.g. "info videl") and Atari OS structures (e.g. "info gemdos").
</p>


<h4>Selecting what information is shown on entering the debugger</h4>

<p>
By using the "lock" command, you can ask Hatari to show specific
information whenever you enter the debugger, e.g. due to a breakpoint.
For example to see disassembly from current PC address, use "lock
disasm".
</p>

<p>
With the "regaddr" subcommand, you see disassembly or memory
dump of an address pointed by a given register ("lock regaddr disasm
a0"). Of the DSP registers, only Rx ones are valid for this
subcommand.
</p>

<p>
"file" subcommand can be used to get (arbitrary number of) commands
parsed and executed from a given debugger input file whenever debugger
is entered.  With this you can output any information you need:
</p>
<pre>
lock file debugger.ini
</pre>

<p>
To disable showing of this extra information, use "lock default".
Without arguments "lock" command will show the available options
(like the "info" command does).
</p>


<h3>Debug symbols</h3>

<p>
You can load debugging symbols to the debugger with the "symbols"
command (and with "dspsymbols" for DSP). These symbolic names can be
used in arithmetic expressions and conditional breakpoint expressions.
They also show up in the "disasm" command output and you can trace
calls to them with "trace cpu_symbols" (and DSP symbols with "trace
dsp_symbols").
</p>


<h4>For a program under GEMDOS HD emulation</h4>

<p>
If currently running program contains debug symbol table,
and it is started from GEMDOS HD emulated drive, its symbol names /
addresses are automatically loaded when debugger is entered, and
removed when program terminates.</p>

<p>
Above happens only if there are no symbols loaded when the program
starts. If there are, you can load program symbol data manually with
the following command, after program has been loaded to the memory by
TOS (see <a href="#Breakpoint_variables">setting breakpoint at program
startup</a>):
</p>
<pre>
symbols prg
</pre>

<p>
The options you need to add suitable symbol table to your programs,
depend on which toolchain you use to build it:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>Devpac</em>:</dt>
<dd>"OPT D+,X+"</dd>
<dt><em>AHCC</em>:</dt>
<dd>"-g" and "-l" options for linking</dd>
<dt><em>GCC</em>:</dt>
<dd>"-g" for compilation, and no strip option for linking
(with older Hatari versions that didn't support a.out format,
also "-Wl,--traditional-format" option was needed for linking)</dd>
<dt><em>VBCC</em>:</dt>
<dd>"-g" (can only be used at linking phase), <em>when VBCC
    configuration file uses "-bataritos" option for
    the linker</em></dd>
</dl>

<p>You can view the generated symbols (and convert them to debugger
ASCII format) with tool installed with Hatari:</p>
<pre>
$ gst2ascii -l -o program.tos &gt; program.sym
</pre>
(Options -l and -o are used to exclude useless symbols from the output.)


<h4>For a program on a (disk) image</h4>

<p>
If the program isn't run from a GEMDOS HD emulated drive, but from
a cartridge, floppy or HD image, you need to have the corresponding
program also as a normal host file which location you can give to
the debugger:
</p>
<pre>
symbols /path/to/the/program.tos
</pre>


<h4>ASCII debug symbol files</h4>

<p>
If Hatari complains that your program doesn't have debug symbol table,
or its symbols are in some unsupported format, and you cannot re-compile
it to include a.out or GST/DRI symbols, you have two options:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert the symbols to ASCII format understood by the Hatari debugger.
    Writing converters for other ASCII formats is easy, and Hatari already
    contains converters for DSP LOD files, <span class="commandline">nm</span>
    output for MiNT/a.out binaries and AHCC map files.</li>
<li>Create the ASCII symbols file by hand while you're debugging a program.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> <span class="commandline">nm</span> output for GCC generated
<span class="commandline">a.out</span> binaries includes labels also for loops,
not just functions. While loop labels are fine for debugging, <em>they should
be removed before profiling</em>.  Besides causing misleading profile
results, loop labels can <em>seriously</em> slow down profiling
(call graph tracking is automatically enabled for profiling when debug
symbols are loaded, and operations done on each matched symbol address
cause huge overhead if that match is for something happening every few
instructions).
</p>

<p>ASCII symbols file format is following:</p>
<pre>
e01034 T random
e01076 T kbdvbase
e0107e T supexec
</pre>
<p>
Where 'T' means text (code), 'D' means data and 'B' means BSS section
type of address.  The hexadecimal address, address type letter and the
symbol name are separated by white space.  Empty lines and lines
starting with '#' (comments) are ignored.
</p>

<p>
Debugger will automatically "relocate" the symbol addresses when it
loads them from a program binary, but with ASCII symbol files you need
to give the relocation offset(s) separately, unless the symbol names
are for fixed addresses (like is the case e.g. with EmuTOS):
</p>
<pre>
symbols program.sym TEXT DATA BSS
</pre>
<p>
If you're interested only about code symbols, you can leave DATA and
BSS offsets out (the values of the above virtual debugger variables
like TEXT come from the currently loaded program's basepage, they're
set after the program is loaded by TOS, see "info basepage" output).
</p>


<h4>Debugging resident programs</h4>

<p>When debugging resident (TSR) programs (terminated with a Ptermres()
GEMDOS call), you'll probably have a 'trigger' program that invokes
some functionality in the TSR you want to debug. Loading your 'trigger'
program from a Hatari GEMDOS emulated drive will autoload its symbols,
thus replacing the symbols of your TSR (which you are really interested
in) you loaded previously.</p>

<p>Symbol replacement can be avoided in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using "symbols autoload off" debugger command, or</li>
<li>Loading TSR symbols from an ASCII file (see above). This is the way
to go if your TSR is not a normal Atari program, or you want to filter or
add some symbols (e.g. for profiling)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Breakpoints</h3>

<p>
There are two ways to specify breakpoints for Hatari. First, there are
the simple address breakpoints which trigger when the CPU (or DSP)
program counter hits a given address. Use "a" (or "da" for the DSP)
to create them, for example:
</p>
<pre>
a $e01034
a some_symbol
</pre>

<p>
Note that address breakpoints are just wrappers for conditional
breakpoints so you need to use "b" command to remove or list them.
</p>

<p>
Then there are the conditional breakpoints which can handle much more
complex break condition expressions; they can track changes to
register and memory values with bitmasks, include multiple conditions
for triggering a breakpoint and so on.  Use "b" (or "db" for the DSP)
to manage them.
</p>

<p>Help explains the general syntax:</p>
<pre>
&gt; help b
'breakpoint' or 'b' - set/remove/list conditional CPU breakpoints
Usage:  b &lt;condition&gt; [&amp;&amp; &lt;condition&gt; ...] [:&lt;option&gt;] | &lt;index&gt; | help | all

Set breakpoint with given &lt;conditions&gt;, remove breakpoint with
given &lt;index&gt;, remove all breakpoints with 'all' or output
breakpoint condition syntax with 'help'.  Without arguments,
lists currently active breakpoints.
</pre>

<p>
Unless you give breakpoint one of the pre-defined subcommands ('all',
'help'), index for a breakpoint to remove or no arguments (to list
breakpoints), the arguments are interpreted as a new breakpoint
definition.
</p>

<p>
Each conditional breakpoint can have (currently up to 4) conditions
which are separated by "&amp;&amp;".  All of the breakpoint's
conditions need to be true for a breakpoint to trigger.
</p>


<h4 id="Breakpoint_options">Breakpoint options</h4>

<p>
Normally when a breakpoint is triggered, emulation is stopped and you
get to the debugger. Breakpoint options can be used to affect what
happens when a breakpoint is triggered.  These options are given after
the conditions and are prefixed with ':'.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><em>&lt;count&gt;</em></dt>
<dd>Break only on every &lt;count&gt; hit. For example, to stop
on every other time PC is at given address, use:
<pre>
a $1234 :2
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>once</em></dt>
<dd>
Delete the breakpoint when it is hit, i.e. trigger it only once. It may
be useful if you just want to get a specific address. Or if you're on
an instruction that jumps back to a start of the loop and you want to
finish the loop, you could use:
<pre>
b pc &gt; "pc" :once
continue
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>trace</em></dt>
<dd>
Continue emulation without stopping after printing the value that
triggered the breakpoint and doing other possible option actions.
This is most useful when investigating memory or register value
changes (explained below).
</dd>

<dt><em>lock</em></dt>
<dd>
Show the same information on breakpoint hit as you see when entering
the debugger (see the "lock" command in
<a href="#Inspecting_emulation_state">Inspecting emulation state</a>
above).  This enables also trace option as you would anyway see this
information if debugger would be entered.
</dd>

<dt><em>info &lt;name&gt;</em></dt>
<dd>
Show on breakpoint hits the same information as "info" command would
show (see <a href="#Inspecting_emulation_state">Inspecting emulation
state</a> above).  With "lock" option and command there is more control
over what information is shown, whereas with "info" option, every
breakpoint can show different information, and one doesn't need to
change what's shown on entering the debugger.  This option also
enables trace option.
</dd>

<dt><em>file &lt;file&gt;</em></dt>
<dd>
Execute debugger commands from given &lt;file&gt; when this breakpoint
is hit.  With this you have complete control over what information is
show when the debugger is hit, you can even chain breakpoints (as
explained in
<a href="#Chaining_breakpoints">Chaining breakpoints</a> later on).
Use this when "info" and "lock" options are not enough.
</dd>

<dt><em>noinit</em></dt>
<dd>
Avoid debugger initialization (profiling data reset and disassembly
address being set to current PC) on breakpoint hit. This enables trace
option as entering debugger would anyway re-initialize debugger state.
This option is mainly intended for breakpoints that use either
":file" or ":lock" option to show backtraces with "profile stack"
command during <a href="#Profiling">profiling</a>.  See
<a href="#Usage_examples">Usage examples</a> section for an example.
</dd>

<dt><em>quiet</em></dt>
<dd>
Inhibit showing of general breakpoint hit information i.e. show only
the additional information that breakpoint outputs.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Note: you can give multiple options for conditional breakpoints, but
for address breakpoints you can give only one these options. "file"
and "info" options are supported only for conditional breakpoints.
</p>


<h4>Breakpoint conditions</h4>

<p>
"b help" explains very briefly the breakpoint condition syntax:
</p>
<pre>
&gt; b help
condition = &lt;value&gt;[.mode] [&amp; &lt;mask&gt;] &lt;comparison&gt; &lt;value&gt;[.mode]

where:
        value = [(] &lt;register/symbol/variable name | number&gt; [)]
        number/mask = [#|$|%]&lt;digits&gt;
        comparison = '&lt;' | '&gt;' | '=' | '!'
        addressing mode (width) = 'b' | 'w' | 'l'
        addressing mode (space) = 'p' | 'x' | 'y'
</pre>

<p>
For CPU breakpoints, mode is the address width; it can be byte ("b"),
word ("w") or long ("l", default).  For DSP breakpoints, mode specifies
the address space: "P", "X" or "Y". Note that on DSP only R0-R7
registers can be used for memory addressing.  For example;
<pre>
db (r0).x = 1 &amp;&amp; (r0).y = 2
</pre>

<p>
If the value is in parenthesis like in '($ff820)' or '(a0)', then the
used value will be read from the memory address pointed by it.  Note
that this conditional breakpoint expression value is checked at
run-time whereas quoted arithmetic expressions (mentioned in
<a href="#Entering_arguments_to_debugger_commands">Entering arguments
to debugger commands</a> above) are evaluated already when
adding a breakpoint.  For example, to break when a value in an address
(later) pointed by A0 matches the value <em>currently</em> in D0, one
would use:
</p>
<pre>
b (a0) = "d0"
</pre>

<p>
If you're interested only on certain bits in the value, you can use
'&amp;' and a numeric mask on either side of comparison operator to
mask the corresponding value, like this:
<pre>
b ($ff820).w &amp; 3 = (a0)  &amp;&amp;  (a1) = d0 &amp; %1100
</pre>

<p>
Comparison operators should be familiar and obvious, except for '!'
which indicates inequality ("is not") comparison.  For example:
</p>
<pre>
b d0 &gt; $20  &amp;&amp;  d0 &lt; $40  &amp;&amp;  d0 ! $30
</pre>


<h5>Tracking breakpoint conditions</h5>

<p>
As a convenience, if the both sides of the comparison are exactly the
same (i.e. condition is redundant as it is always either true or
false), the <em>right side</em> of the comparison is replaced with
its current value.  This way you can give something like this:
</p>
<pre>
b pc &gt; "pc"
</pre>
<p>As:</p>
<pre>
b pc &gt; pc
</pre>

<p>
That in itself isn't so useful, but for inequality ('!') comparison,
conditional breakpoint will additionally track and output all further
changes for the given address/register expression. This can be used
for example to find out all value changes in a given memory address,
like this:
</p>
<pre>
b ($ffff9202).w ! ($ffff9202).w :trace
</pre>
<p>
Because tracking breakpoint conditions will print the evaluated
value when it changes, they're typically used with the trace option
to track changes e.g. to some I/O register.
</p>


<h5>Breakpoint condition notes</h5>

<ul>
<li>
Any '!' condition should be given as the first condition. Because
breakpoint evaluation is stopped ("short-circuited") when any of the
conditions fails, the tracked value would not be updated correctly
unless tracking condition is given as the first one.
</li>

<li>
Hatari will internally update some register values without immediately
updating the corresponding I/O address range memory addresses.  For
example the Busy bit for the internal Blitter control register is
(internally) cleared when Blitter activity stops, but the actual I/O
address for that control register gets updated only when something
actually writes or reads that I/O address.  Many HW registers behave
like this (status registers in FDC, ACIA, MFP, Blitter...).
<br>
For breakpoints that track just a single I/O register memory address, or
multiple ones of which <strong>none</strong> are modified by Hatari,
only by emulated code, this is not a problem, they get triggered as
expected.
<br>
However, if you have a breakpoint that tracks multiple I/O registers
where some of them are updated by Hatari, for example to check that
other Blitter registers aren't updated while control register
indicates Blitter to be active (busy), things don't work as expected!
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Breakpoint variables</h4>

<p>
In addition to loaded symbols, the debugger supports also setting
conditional breakpoints on values of some "virtual" variables listed
by "variables" (v) command. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Aes/Bios/Gemdos/LineA/LineF/Vdi/XbiosOpcode variables can be used
    to catch AES, BIOS, GEMDOS, Line-A, Line-F, VDI and XBIOS OS-calls.
    By default they contain the 0xffff value, so to trace e.g. all AES
    calls (instead of a specific one) one needs to use something like this:
<pre>
b  AesOpcode ! AesOpcode  &amp;&amp;  AesOpcode &lt; 0xffff  :trace
</pre>
</li>
<li>To stop when TOS starts loading next program, set a breakpoint for
    Pexec(0,...) OS call:
<pre>
b GemdosOpcode = 0x4B &amp;&amp; OsCallParam = 0x0
</pre>
</li>
<li>To stop emulation after program has been loaded, but before
    it runs, set next breakpoint on its first instruction i.e. when
    program counter matches the TEXT (code) segment address (taken
    from program basepage):
<pre>
b  pc = TEXT :once
</pre>
Note1: It is better to trigger this breakpoint only once, because if
you would leave it on, during (re)boot you would get a warning for
every instruction (until TOS sets a valid basepage).
<br />
Note2: you cannot use an <em>address</em> breakpoint for this because
variable values are evaluated at run-time only for conditional
breakpoints.
</li>
<li>To view current program DATA and BSS segment contents,
    use the corresponding variables:
<pre>
m  DATA
m  BSS
</pre>
</li>
<li>If you want to stop at a specific cycle within a frame (that is,
    PC relative to the current VBL/HBL in cycles), set breakpoints to
    specific "VBL", "FrameCycles", "HBL" and "LineCycles" variable
    values.  If you want, for example, to break after 20 HBLs, use:
<pre>
b  HBL = "HBL+20"
</pre>
</li>
<li>To stop on every symbol, break on:
<pre>
b  PConSymbol = 1
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hint: "info" command "aes", "bios", "gemdos", "vdi" and "xbios"
subcommands can be used to list the corresponding OS-call opcodes.
For example, to see the GEMDOS opcodes, use:</p>
<pre>
info gemdos 1
</pre>


<h4 id="Chaining_breakpoints">Chaining breakpoints and other actions</h4>

<p>
As the file pointed by the breakpoint ":file" option (see
<a href="#Breakpoint_options">Breakpoint options</a>) can contain any
debugger commands, it can also be used to do automatic "chaining" of
debugger and breakpoint actions so that after one breakpoint is hit,
another one is set.
</p>

<p>For example if you have these input files:</p>
<ul>
<li>"pexec.ini":
<pre>
# continue to "program.ini" on Pexec(0, ....)
b GemdosOpcode = 0x4B &amp;&amp; OsCallParam = 0x0 :trace :once :file program.ini
</pre>
</li>
<li>"program.ini":
<pre>
# continue to "trace.ini" when program execution starts
b pc = TEXT :trace :once :file trace.ini
</pre>
</li>
<li>"trace.ini":
<pre>
# load symbols, trace gemdos &amp; program function calls
symbols prg
trace gemdos,cpu_symbols
# continue to "disable.ini" after 4 VBLs
b VBL = "VBL+4" :trace :once :file disable.ini
</pre>
</li>
<li>"disable.ini":
<pre>
# stop tracing and remove breakpoints
trace none
b all
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
And then start Hatari with the first debugger input file:
</p>
<pre>
hatari --parse pexec.ini /path/to/your/program.tos
</pre>

<ol>
<li>"pexec.ini" sets a breakpoint to parse debugger commands from
    "program.ini" when TOS starts loading the given program
    (it is first Pexec(0) after boot)</li>
<li>"program.ini" sets a breakpoint to parse debugger commands from
    "trace.ini" when program code begins executing.  These two steps
    are needed because TEXT variable isn't valid until TOS has booted</li>
<li>"trace.ini" input file loads symbols for the run program, sets Hatari
    to trace several things (see <a href="#Tracing">Tracing</a> section
    below) in the emulated system for few VBLs until breakpoint runs
    commands from the "disable.ini" file</li>
<li>"disable.ini" input file will disable tracing and remove
    all (remaining) breakpoints</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Because debugger input files cannot "continue"
emulation, ":trace" option needs to be used for the breakpoint(s)
if you want emulation to continue after the breakpoint action(s).</li>
<li>In simpler breakpoint chain (like above), where new breakpoint
just replaces the previous one, ":once" option tells debugger that
breakpoint isn't needed after it is hit.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hint: It is better to test each input file separately before testing
the whole chain.  Besides the ":file" breakpoint option, you can test
these debugger input files also with the debugger "file" command,
"file" option for the "lock" command, and with the Hatari "--parse"
command line option.
</p>

<h3 id="Stepping">Stepping through code</h3>

<p>
After analyzing the emulation state and/or setting new breakpoints,
you can continue the emulation with the "c" command. You can continue
for a given number of CPU instructions (or DSP instructions when "dc"
is used), or you can continue forever (until a non-tracing breakpoint
triggers) if you omit the instruction count.
</p>

<p>
If you want to continue just to the next instruction, use "s" (step)
command to continue for exactly one instruction, or "n" (next), if you
want to skip subroutine + exception calls and DBCC branching backwards
(i.e. loops).  "ds" and "dn" commands do the same for DSP (except that
"dn" doesn't skip loops).
</p>

<p>
You can also continue with the "n" until instruction of certain
type is encountered, by giving it the instruction type:
<ul>
<li>"branch" matches branch instructions:<br>
    CPU: BCC, BRA, DBCC, JMP<br>
    DSP: DO/ENDO JCC, JCLR, JMP, JSET, REP</li>
<li>"subcall" matches subroutine calls:<br>
    CPU: BSR, JSR<br>
    DSP: JSCC, JSCLR, JSSET, JSR</li>
<li>"subreturn" matches return from subroutine:<br>
    CPU: RTD, RTR, RTS<br>
    DSP: RTS</li>
<li>"exception" matches exceptions:<br>
    CPU: BKPT, ILLG, STOP, TRAP, TRAPV</li>
<li>"exreturn" matches return from exception:<br>
    CPU: RTE<br>
    DSP: RTI</li>
<li>"return" matches both subroutine and exception returns</li>
</ul>

<p>
"subreturn" differs from others by running until current subroutine
ends, even if other subroutines are called before that.  This is
particularly useful for profiling more complex functions; set
breakpoint on function start, enable profiling and run until that
functions returns, to get its full profile. Example: "n subreturn",
or "dn subreturn".
</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>"next subreturn" works only for real subroutines i.e. code called
    with BSR/JSR and returning with RT[DRS]. In (GCC) optimized compiled
    C-code, calls to functions in same C / object file may get inlined
    or just called with JMP.  If that's the case, and making the
    function non-static doesn't help, move it to another C-file</li>
<li>"exreturn" and "return" run only until first instruction of given
    type is encountered.  They cannot implement similar functionality
    as "subreturn", because it's not possible for "next" command to
    track CPU / DSP exception invocations, and therefore it cannot
    do call depth tracking required for this either</li>
<li>Tracking CPU CHK2 and FPU FBCC, FDBCC &amp; FTRAPCC exception /
    branch instructions isn't supported currently</li>
</ul>


<h3>Tracing</h3>

<p>
(Hatari needs to be built with ENABLE_TRACING define set for
tracing to work. By default it is.)
</p>

<p>
If you want e.g. to continue with real-time disassembling, you can
enable it with "trace cpu_disasm" (or "trace dsp_disasm" for DSP) at
the debugger prompt before continuing.
</p>
<p>
Disable tracing with "trace none" when you enter the debugger again.
"trace help" (or TAB) can be used to list all the (over 40) supported
traceable things, from HW events to OS functions.
</p>
<p>
At run-time you can enable and disable trace flags individually by
starting the trace flags with -/+, like this:
</p>
<pre>
trace gemdos,aes,vdi   # trace just these
trace +xbios,bios      # trace additionally these
trace -aes,-vdi        # remove tracing of these
</pre>
<p>
('+' is optional for addition except at start of the trace flags list.)
</p>
<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If GEMDOS HD emulation isn't enabled, GEMDOS call tracing needs to be
enabled at Hatari command line, it is not possible to enable it after
TOS has initialized GEMDOS.
</li>
<li>
AES, BIOS, GEMDOS and XBIOS traces show arguments for (most of) the
calls, VDI trace shows only function calls (parsing the arguments
would be too complicated).
</li>
<li>
Tracing options can be set even from a program within the emulation,
if you enable the (deprecated) "--bios-intercept" option and call
XBios 255 from the program with a suitable trace options string.
</li>
<li>
Note that the trace output file can be set only when Hatari starts,
it cannot be changed from within the debugger (or emulation).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If there isn't a trace option for something you would like to track,
you may be able to use tracing breakpoints, explained above.
For example, following tracks Line-A calls:
</p>
<pre>
b  LineAOpcode ! LineAOpcode  &amp;&amp;  LineAOpcode &lt; 0xffff  :trace
</pre>



<h3>Profiling</h3>

<p>
Profiling tells where the emulated code spends most of its (emulated)
time.  It can be used to find out where a program is (apparently)
stuck, or what are the largest performance bottlenecks for a program.
</p>

<h4>Collecting the profile data</h4>

<p>
Profiling is used by first enabling the profiler (use "dp" for DSP):
</p>
<pre>
&gt; profile on
Profiling enabled.
</pre>
<p>
And profiling will start once you continue the emulation:
</p>
<pre>
&gt; c
Returning to emulation...
Allocated CPU profile buffer (27 MB).
</pre>

<p>
When you get back to the debugger, the collected profiling information
is processed and a summary of in which parts of memory the execution
happened, and how long it took, is shown:
</p>
<pre>
Allocated CPU profile address buffer (57 KB).
ROM TOS (0xE00000-0xE80000):
- active address range:
  0xe00030-0xe611a4
- active instruction addresses:
  14240 (100.00% of all)
- executed instructions:
  4589668 (100.00% of all)
- used cycles:
  56898472 (100.00% of all)
  = 7.09347s
Cartridge ROM (0xFA0000-0xFC0000):
  - no activity

= 7.09347s
</pre>
<p>
(DSP RAM will be shown only as single area in profile information.)
</p>


<h4>Investigating the profile data</h4>

<p>
When you are back in debugger, you can inspect the collected profile data:
</p>
<pre>
&gt; h profile
'profile' - profile CPU code
Usage:  profile &lt;subcommand&gt; [parameter]

	Subcommands:
		- on
		- off
		- counts [count]
		- cycles [count]
		- i-misses [count]
		- d-hits [count]
		- symbols [count]
		- addresses [address]
		- callers
		- caches
		- stack
		- stats
		- save &lt;file&gt;
		- loops &lt;file&gt; [CPU limit] [DSP limit]

	'on' &uml; 'off' enable and disable profiling.  Data is collected
	until debugger is entered again at which point you get profiling
	statistics ('stats') summary.

	Then you can ask for list of the PC addresses, sorted either by
	execution 'counts', used 'cycles', i-cache misses or d-cache hits.
	First can be limited just to named addresses with 'symbols'.
	Optional count will limit how many items will be shown.

	'caches' shows histogram of CPU cache usage.

	'addresses' lists the profiled addresses in order, with the
	instructions (currently) residing at them.  By default this
	starts from the first executed instruction, or you can
	specify the starting address.

	'callers' shows (raw) caller information for addresses which
	had symbol(s) associated with them.  'stack' shows the current
	profile stack (this is useful only with :noinit breakpoints).

	Profile address and callers information can be saved with
	'save' command.

	Detailed (spin) looping information can be collected by
	specifying to which file it should be saved, with optional
	limit(s) on how many bytes first and last instruction
	address of the loop can differ (0 = no limit).
</pre>

<p>For example, to see which memory addresses were executed most
and what instructions those have at the end of profiling, use:</p>
<pre>
&gt; profile counts 8
addr:           count:
0xe06f10        12.11%  555724  move.l    $4ba,d1
0xe06f16        12.11%  555724  cmp.l     d1,d0
0xe06f18        12.11%  555724  bgt.s     $e06f06
0xe06f06        12.11%  555708  move.b    $fffffa01.w,d1
0xe06f0a        12.11%  555708  btst      #5,d1
0xe06f0e        12.11%  555708  beq.s     $e06f1e
0xe00ed8         1.66%  76001   subq.l    #1,d0
0xe00eda         1.66%  76001   bpl.s     $e00ed8
8 CPU addresses listed.
</pre>

<p>
Then, to see what the executed code and its costs look like
around top addresses:
<pre>
&gt; profile addresses 0xe06f04
# disassembly with profile data:
# &lt;instructions percentage&gt;% (&lt;sum of instructions&gt;, &lt;sum of cycles&gt;, &lt;sum of i-cache misses&gt;, &lt;sum of d-cache hits&gt;)

$e06f06 :             move.b    $fffffa01.w,d1            12.11% (555708, 8902068, 0, 0)
$e06f0a :             btst      #5,d1                     12.11% (555708, 6685268, 0, 0)

$e06f10 :             move.l    $4ba,d1                   12.11% (555724, 11125668, 0, 0)
$e06f16 :             cmp.l     d1,d0                     12.11% (555724, 4461708, 0, 0)
$e06f18 :             bgt.s     $e06f06                   12.11% (555724, 4455040, 0, 0)
$e06f1a :             moveq     #1,d0                      0.00% (16, 64, 0, 0)
Disassembled 8 (of active 14240) CPU addresses.
</pre>
<p>
Unlike normal disassembly, "profile addresses" command shows only
memory addresses which instructions were executed during profiling.
You get instruction cache misses only when using cycle-accurate 030
emulation.
<p>
If you have loaded symbol information, symbol names are shown above
the corresponding addresses.  With the "profile symbols" command you
get a list of how many times the code execution passed through the
defined symbol addresses.
</p>


<h4>Profile data accuracy</h4>

<p>Profile data accuracy depends on Hatari emulation accuracy.
Profile data accuracy from most to least accurate when Hatari's
default emulation options are used is following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Executed CPU and DSP instruction counts are accurate.</li>
<li>68000 cycle counts have been tested to be accurate to within 1%.</li>
<li>DSP cycle counts (and the variance information) should be accurate.</li>
<li>030 CPU instruction cache hit/miss counts are assumed to be accurate.</li>
<li>As to 680x0 cycles... Cycles used by a given CPU instruction depend
    on what instruction(s) is executed, where it was executed (ST or
    TT-RAM) and what data was processed before it (was it cached).
    E.g. 030 cycle counts can be off by tens of percents.</li>
<li>FPU instruction cycles can be off by 2x.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Caller information</h4>

<p>
If you have loaded symbols (see <a href="#Debug_symbols">Debug symbols</a>)
before continuing emulation/profiling, additional caller information
will be collected for all the code symbol addresses which are called
as subroutines.  This information includes callstack, call counts,
calling instruction type (subroutine call, branch, return etc), and
costs for those calls, both including costs for further subroutine
calls and without them.
</p>

<p>When debugger is re-entered, current callstack is output before
profiling information:</p>
<pre>
&gt; a <em>_P_LineAttack</em>
CPU condition breakpoint 1 with 1 condition(s) added:
        pc = $30f44
$030f44 : 48e7 3820                            movem.l   d2-d4/a2,-(sp)
&gt; c
...
CPU breakpoint condition(s) matched 1 times.
        pc = $30f44
Finalizing costs for 12 non-returned functions:
- 0x32a3c: _P_GunShot (return = 0x32b7e)
- 0x32b18: _A_FireShotgun (return = 0x3229a)

...
</pre>

<p>("profile stack" command can be used in breakpoints with :noinit
option to show backtraces during caller profiling.)</p>

<p>Note: rest of this subsection is about caller information format
which is mainly of interest for people writing profiling
post-processing tools.  Come back here if you think there's
some problem with callgraphs produced by those tools.</p>

<p>Other information collected during profiling is shown with
following command:</p>
<pre>
&gt; profile callers
# &lt;callee&gt;: &lt;caller1&gt; = &lt;calls&gt; &lt;types&gt;[ &lt;inclusive/totals&gt;[ &lt;exclusive/totals&gt;]], &lt;caller2&gt; ..., &lt;callee name&gt;
# types: s = subroutine call, r = return from subroutine, e = exception, x = return from exception,
#        b = branch/jump, n = PC moved to next instruction, u = unknown PC change

...
</pre>

<p>
For example, if you don't know all the places from which a certain
function is called, or in what context a certain interrupt handler can
be called during the period you are profiling, profile caller
information will tell you:
</p>
<pre>
callee: caller: calls: calltype:

(Most "calls" to "dsp_interrupt" were subroutine call returns (=r)
to it from address 0x155.)
</p>

<p>
With the execution counts in normal profiling data, caller information
can actually be used to have complete picture of what exactly the code
did during profiling.  Main/overview work for this analysis is best done
automatically, by the profiler data post-processor (documented below).
</p>


<h4>Caller data accuracy</h4>

<p>Everything about profile data accuracy applies also to caller costs,
but there are additional things to take into account, mainly because
profiler cannot determine when exceptions are being handled:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are exception(s) during a subroutine call, costs for
    the exception handling will also be accounted for that subroutine.
    This shouldn't be a problem unless those costs are very large,
    i.e. check how much CPU your exception handlers take.</li>
<li>Indicated exception handler call type can be incorrect.</li>
<li>Profiled code doing return address related stack manipulations
    confuses call tracking and produces incorrect results (profiler
    has special code to handle EmuTOS AES switcher because of this).
    Typically this produces large list of functions that are finalized
    at profile end, so it should be easy to detect.</li>
<li>Complicated recursive calls seem to sometimes cause inclusive
    costs (ones including costs of further subroutine calls) to be
    incorrect.  Sometimes this can be noticed by them being even
    &gt;100%.</li>
<li>On DSP, profiler heuristics assume (for speed reasons) that
    <em>conditional</em> subroutine calls never call the very next
    instruction (as that would be very bad/inefficient code).</li>
</ul>


<h4>Saving profile data to a file</h4>

<p>It is useful to save the profile data to a file:</p>
<pre>
&gt; profile save program-profile.txt
</pre>

<p>With the saved profile disassembly (and optional caller information)
you can more easily investigate what your program did during
profiling, search symbols &amp; addresses in it, and compare the
results to profiles you have saved from earlier versions of your code.</p>

<p>You may even create your own post-processing tools for
investigating the profiling data more closely, e.g. to
<a href="http://www.atari-forum.com/viewtopic.php?f=68&amp;t=24561&amp;start=75#p226505">find
CPU/DSP communication bottlenecks</a>.</p>


<h3>Profile data post-processing</h3>

<p>Saved profile data can be post-processed with (Python) script
installed by Hatari, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get lists of functions/symbols with highest costs.</li>
<li>Get callgraphs of what functions/symbols cause those
    costs and what kind of call hierarchy the profiled code
    has.</li>
<li>Export profile data in Valgrind's
    <a href="http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cl-format.html">Callgrind format</a>
    for viewing it in
    <a href="http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/">Kcachegrind</a>
    GUI.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Providing symbols for the post-processor</h4>

<p>When the data is post-processed, you should always provide
the post-processor symbols for the profile code!  Relying just on the
symbol in the profile data can cause costs to be assigned to wrong
symbol, if symbol's code wasn't called through symbol's own address,
but by jumping inside its code.</p>

<p>If your code is in fixed location, you should tell
post-processor to handle symbol addresses as absolute (-a):</p>
<pre>
$ hatari_profile.py <b>-a</b> etos1024k.sym emutos-profile.txt
</pre>

<p>Normal programs are relocated and you should instead give
the symbols as TEXT (code) section relative ones (-r):</p>
<pre>
$ hatari_profile.py <b>-r</b> program.sym program-profile.txt
</pre>

<p>If symbols are included to your binary, first they need to be
extracted to <a href="#Debug_symbols">the ASCII format</a>
understood by the post-processor:</p>
<pre>
$ gst2ascii -a -l -o program.prg &gt; program.sym
</pre>

<p>If there are some extra symbols that you don't want to see
separately in profiles, because they aren't real functions,
but e.g. loop labels, you can either remove them manually
from the ASCII *.sym file, or filter them out with grep:
</p>
<pre>
$ gst2ascii -a -l -o program.prg | grep -v -e useless1 -e useless2 &gt; program.sym
</pre>


<h4>Post-processor provided statistics</h4>

</pre>

<p>Now there's a message telling that some of the calls were ignored
because according to their "call type", they were actually returns from
exceptions, not real calls (this is mainly important for callgraph
generation, discussed below).</p>


<h4>Interpreting the results</h4>

<p>In addition to accuracy issues mentioned in previous Profiling
sections, function/symbol level costs have gotchas of their own.</p>

<p>The first cost percentage and count columns are <em>sums for all
the instructions</em> that were in profile data file <em>between
the indicated symbol's address and the address of the next symbol</em>
(= "between-symbols" cost).</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If your symbol file doesn't contain addresses
for all the relevant symbols, results from this can be misleading because
instructions costs get assigned to <em>whatever</em> symbol's address
happened to precede those instructions.  And you don't see which
caller is causing it from caller info or callgraph either, as entry
point for that time sink lacking a symbol means profiler hadn't
tracked calls to it...</p>

<p>The next two cost percentage and count columns are for <em>subroutine
calls costs</em>, first one for exclusive and latter for inclusive cost
i.e. including costs for further subroutine calls.  Values are based on
caller information documented above.</p>

<p>Reasons why between-symbol costs, and subroutine call costs can
differ, are following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subroutine terminates before next symbol address: exclusive
    cost is smaller than in-between cost <em>because of missing
    symbol information</em>
    (these are indicated with '*' in statistics).</li>
<li>Subroutine is called more through jumps/branches than through
    subroutine calls: inclusive call count may be smaller than
    in-between call count which includes branches/jumps.</li>
<li>Subroutine jumps/branches to another function instead of
    using subroutine call, or function contains additional
    (non-function) labels: exclusive cost is larger than
    in-between cost.</li>
<li>Exception happening during subroutine call: exclusive cost is
    (slightly) larger than in-between cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first case, you should check the profile data to find out
whether there are missing symbols for executed function entry points.
You can notice function entry points as address gap and/or code
retrieving arguments from stack. Exit points can be seen from RTS
instructions.</p>

<p>Second case can also be seen from the profile data.  Call count
is same as count for how many times first instruction is executed
(worst case: large loop on subroutine's first instruction).</p>

<p>While subroutine costs should be more accurate and relevant, due to
code optimizations many of the functions are not called as subroutines
(on m68k, using JSR/BSR), but just jumped or branched to.  Because of
this, it is useful to compare both subroutine and between-symbols
costs.  One should be able to see from the profile disassembly which
of the above cases is cause for the discrepancy in the values.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Before starting to do any serious source
level optimizations, you should <em>always</em> verify from profile
data (disassembly) where exactly the costs are in a function, to make
sure your optimization efforts can actually help the performance.</p>


<h4>Generating and viewing callgraphs</h4>

<p>Callgraphs require that saved profile data contains caller
function address information, i.e. symbols for the code should
be loaded before starting profiling it (see
<a href="#Debug_symbols">loading symbol data</a>).</p>

<p>Separate callgraphs will be created for each of the costs
(0=calls, 1=instructions, 2=cycles) with the -g option:</p>
<pre>
$ hatari_profile.py <b>-p -g</b> -r program.sym program-profile.txt
[...]
Generating 'program-profile-0.dot' DOT callgraph file...

Generating 'program-profile-1.dot' DOT callgraph file...

Generating 'program-profile-2.dot' DOT callgraph file...
[...]
</pre>

<p>Callgraphs are saved in <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a>
"dot" format.  Dot files can be viewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>With "dotty" program included with GraphViz</li>
<li>With <a href="https://github.com/jrfonseca/xdot.py">XDot</a>
    Python GUI (best option on Linux), or some platform specific viewer</li>
<li>By converting dot file to PostScript or SVG format before
    viewing it with viewers for those:
<pre>
$ dot -Tsvg program-profile-1.dot &gt; program-profile-1.svg
</pre>
    (problem with most PS/PDF and SVG viewers is that either they
    don't allow zooming large callgraphs enough or they use huge
    amounts of memory and get very slow)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Produced callgraph will look like this:</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
  <a href="images/callgraph.svg">
    <img src="images/callgraph.png" width="953" height="589"
         alt="Part of callgraph" />
  </a>
</div>

<p>Interpreting the callgraph:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diamond shaped nodes are symbols called as subroutines.
    Values listed in them are subroutine call costs; inclusive
    (total) cost with exclusive (own) cost in parenthesis,
    followed by inclusive cost count.  Exclusive cost is
    shown only if it differs from inclusive one.</li>
<li>Ellipse shaped nodes are for other symbols (functions
    called using jumps/branches, loop labels etc).  Values
    listed in them are between-symbols costs, i.e. normally
    they are included to inclusive (total) costs shown in
    subroutine call node somewhere higher in call hierarchy.</li>
<li>Nodes which exclusive (own) or between-symbols costs
    exceed default or explicitly given threshold value,
    have gray background.</li>
<li>Both nodes, which inclusive or between-symbols cost exceeds
    the threshold value, and the arrows to &amp; from them,
    are marked red.</li>
<li>Arrow types indicate call types; normal arrows subroutine
    calls, circles branches/jumps, backarrows returns.
    Exception calls and returns are indicated with dashed lines,
    unknown calls with dotted lines.</li>
<li>Arrow text tells from which address (within the caller)
    the call originated.  If symbol had multiple callers, text
    includes count of calls from that particular address, and its
    percentage is of all calls done to that symbol.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Making large callgraphs readable</h4>

<p>
If profile is for larger and more varied amount of code (e.g. program startup),
the resulting callgraph can be so huge that it not really readable anymore.
</p>

<p>If your code has interrupt handlers, they can get called
at any point, which can show in callgraph as "explicit" calls
from the interrupted functions.  To get rid of such incorrect
calls, give interrupt handler names to --ignore-to option:</p>
<pre>
$ hatari_profile.py -p -g <b>--ignore-to handler1,handler2</b> -r program.sym program-profile.txt
</pre>

<p>In large callgraph most of the functions aren't really interesting,
because their contribution to the cost is insignificant. You can
remove large number of them with --no-leafs and --no-intermediate
options, those options act <em>only</em> on nodes which costs are below
given threshold.  Leaf nodes are ones which don't have any parents
and/or children. Intermediate ones have only single parent and
children (node calling itself is not taken into account).

<p>Threshold for this is given with the --limit (-l) option.  With
that it typically makes also sense to change the node emphasis
threshold with --emph-limit (-e) option:</p>
<pre>
$ hatari_profile.py -p -g <b>-l 0.5 -e 2.0</b> -r program.sym program-profile.txt
</pre>

<p>If you are not interested in from how many different addresses
a given function calls another function, use --compact option.  If you
still see multiple calls between two nodes with it, the reason is that
they happened through different call paths which were removed from
the callgraph after --compact option was applied:</p>
<pre>
$ hatari_profile.py -p -g -l 1.0 -e 2.0 <b>--no-leafs --no-intermediate --compact</b> -r program.sym program-profile.txt
</pre>

<p>If even this doesn't help, you can remove all nodes below
the given cost threshold limit with --no-limited option, but this
often doesn't leave much of a call hierarchy.  Instead you may
consider removing all nodes except for subroutine call ones, with the
--only-subroutines option.</p>

<p>If you have trouble locating nodes you are specially interested
about, you can either color them differently with the --mark option,
or exclude everything else from the callgraph except those nodes and
their immediate callers &amp; callees, with the --only option:</p>
<pre>
$ hatari_profile.py -p -g <b>--only func1,func2</b> -r program.sym program-profile.txt
</pre>

<p>Last option for reading the callgraph is using -k option to
export the data for use in (Linux) Kcachegrind UI. Kcachegrind generates
callgraphs on the fly, and just for the area around the function
you selected, so navigating in callgraph may be easier.  It also
shows the related profile disassembly, which can make verifying
matters easier:</p>
<pre>
$ hatari_profile.py <b>-p -k</b> -r program.sym program-profile.txt
[...]

[...]
$ kcachegrind program-profile.cg

<h3>Usage examples</h3>

<p>
Here's a list of some common debugging tasks and how to do them
with the Hatari debugger:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><em>Stopping on program startup and examining its data</em></dt>
<dd>Please see <a href="#Breakpoint_variables">Breakpoint variables</a>
and <a href="#Inspecting_emulation_state">Inspecting emulation state</a>
sections.
</dd>

<dt><em>Tracing specific things in the system</em></dt>
<dd>To trace e.g. all GEMDOS calls and I/O operations, use:
<pre>
trace  gemdos,io_all
</pre>
Please see <a href="#Tracing">Tracing</a> section for more information
on tracing, what's possible with it and what are its limitations.
</dd>

<dt><em>Stopping when certain PC address is passed Nth time</em></dt>
<dd>To stop e.g. after function/subroutine at $12345 is called for
the 6th time:
<pre>
a  $12345 :6
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Stopping when specific exception happens</em></dt>
<dd>If one wants a specific breakpoint to trigger on a specific
exception, one can check when its handler address is called by the
CPU. At the start of memory is the CPU exception table for exception
vectors.  So, to stop e.g. at bus error with some extra information,
one can use following:
<pre>
history  on
b  pc=($8)
</pre>
After bus error invokes debugger, 'history' command can then be used
to see (executed memory addresses with their current) instructions
leading to the error.  The most interesting vector addresses are:
$8 (Bus error), $C (Address error), $10 (Illegal instruction),
$14 (Division by zero).<br>
NOTE: Normally, to invoke debugger for larger set of exceptions, one
would use Hatari's "--debug-except" option to specify on which
exceptions debugger is invoked, and "setopt -D" to enable that on
run-time.
</dd>

<dt><em>Stopping when register has a specific value</em></dt>
<dd>To stop when e.g. D1 register contains value 5, set a breakpoint on:
<pre>
b  d1 = 5
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Stopping when a register value changes</em></dt>
<dd>To stop when e.g. D1 register value changes, set a breakpoint on:
<pre>
b  d1 ! d1
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Stopping when part of register value changes</em></dt>
<dd>To stop when e.g. D1 register lowest byte changes, set a
breakpoint on masked lowest 8 bits:
<pre>
b  d1 &amp; 0xff ! d1 &amp; 0xff
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Stopping when register value is within some range</em></dt>
<dd>To stop when e.g. D1 register value is within range of 10-30,
set a breakpoint on:
<pre>
b  d1 &gt; 9  &amp;&amp;  d1 &lt; 31
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Stopping when memory location has a specific value</em></dt>
<dd>To stop when e.g. bit 1 of the Video Shifter Sync Mode byte at
I/O address $ff820a is set i.e. video frequency is 60Hz, set
a breakpoint on:
<pre>
b  ($ff820a).b &amp; 2 = 2
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Stopping when a memory value changes</em></dt>
<dd>To stop when above bit changes, set a breakpoint on its value
being different from the current value ('!' compares for inequality):
<pre>
b  ($ff820a).b &amp; 2 ! ($ff820a).b &amp; 2
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Tracing all changes in specific memory location</em></dt>
<dd>To see the new values and continue without stopping, add
the ":trace" breakpoint option:
<pre>
b  ($ff820a).b &amp; 2 ! ($ff820a).b &amp; 2  :trace
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Viewing OS structure and IO register values</em></dt>
<dd>To see e.g. basepage for currently running program:
<pre>
info  basepage
</pre>
To see e.g. all Falcon Videl register values, use:
<pre>
info  videl
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Showing OS attribute information for specific OS calls</em></dt>
<dd>To see e.g. VDI attributes for all v_gtext VDI calls:
<pre>
b  VdiOpcode = $8  :quiet :info vdi
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Stopping at specific screen position</em></dt>
<dd>To stop e.g. when VBL is 100, HBL is 40 and line cycles is 5,
use the corresponding debugger variables:
<pre>
b  VBL = 100  &amp;&amp;  HBL = 40  &amp;&amp;  LineCycles = 5
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Stopping after value increases/decreases by certain amount</em></dt>
<dd>To stop e.g. after D0 value has increased by 10, set breakpoint on:
<pre>
b  d0 = "d0 + 10"
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Examining specific system call return value</em></dt>
<dd>To check e.g. what's the Fopen() GEMDOS call return value,
check with "info gemdos 1" its opcode, set a breakpoint for that
and step to next (n) instruction from the trap call when breakpoint
is hit. GEMDOS call return value is then in register D0:
<pre>
&gt; trace  gemdos
&gt; b  GemdosOpcode = $3D
&gt; c
[...continue until breakpoint...]
1. CPU breakpoint condition(s) matched 1 times.
        GemdosOpcode = $3D
&gt; n
GEMDOS 0x3D Fopen("TEST.TXT", read-only)
&gt; e  d0
= %1000000 (bin), #64 (dec), $40 (hex)
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Seeing code leading to a breakpoint</em></dt>
<dd>To see CPU instructions executed before debugger was entered,
you need to enable history tracking <em>before</em> it. Whenever
debugger is entered, you can then request given number (here 16) of
past instructions to be shown:
<pre>
history  cpu
c
[breakpoint is hit and debugger entered]
history  16
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Getting instruction execution history for every breakpoint</em></dt>
<dd>
To see last 16 instructions for both CPU and DSP whenever
(a normal or tracing) breakpoint is hit:
<pre>
history  on
lock  history 16
c
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Single stepping so that new register values are shown after each step</em></dt>
<dd>
<pre>
lock  registers
s
[new register values]
s
[new register values]
...
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Showing current stack contents</em></dt>
<dd>To see first 64 bytes on top of the stack, use:
<pre>
m  "a7-64"-a7
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Seeing specific information each time debugger is entered</em></dt>
<dd>To see above information whenever some breakpoint is hit,
you enter debugger manually etc, write that command to e.g.
<span class="file">stack.ini</span> file and then use:
<pre>
lock  file stack.ini
</pre>
Please see also <a href="#Chaining_breakpoints">Chaining breakpoints</a>
section for more examples on what you can do with the debugger input files.
</dd>

<dt><em>Adding cycle information to disassembly</em></dt>
<dd>Profiling collects cycle usage information for all executed instructions:
<pre>
profile  on
c
[after a while, use AltGr+Pause to get back to debugger]
d
[or if you want to see just the executed instructions]
profile addresses
</pre>
Please see <a href="#Profiling">Profiling</a> section for more info.
</dd>

<dt><em>Finding where a program or the OS is stuck</em></dt>
<dd>Profiling tells from which addresses CPU is executing the instructions:
<pre>
profile  on
c
[after a while, use AltGr+Pause to get back to debugger]
profile  addresses
</pre>
Please see <a href="#Profiling">Profiling</a> section for more info.
</dd>

<dt><em>Profiling specific function and everything it calls</em></dt>
<dd>Set breakpoint for the function entrypoint and when it is hit,
enable profiling and continue to the end of the function:
<pre>
address myfunction
c
[back in debugger at myfunction]
profile on
next subreturn
[back in debugger when function returns]
</pre>
Please see <a href="#Profiling">Profiling</a> section on and how
to save and analyze profiling information after that, and
<a href="#Stepping">Stepping</a> section for some "next subreturn"
command limitations.
</dd>

<dt><em>Seeing program callstack when breakpoint is hit</em></dt>
<dd><a href="#Caller_information">Profiler caller data</a> includes
callstack information (with some limitations).
</dd>

<dt><em>Seeing call backtraces whenever given function is called</em></dt>
<dd>Enable profiling, load symbols for the program and set breakpoint
for the function you are interested about, in the following way:
<pre>
profile  on
symbols  prg
b  pc = _my_function  :quiet :noinit :file showstack.ini
</pre>
I.e. whenever 'my_function' address is called, quietly trigger a
breakpoint without resetting profiling (callstack) information and run
debugger command(s) from the 'showstack.ini' debugger script file,
which contains following command:
<pre>
profile  stack
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>Seeing how program functions/symbols call each other</em></dt>
<dd><a href="#Profile_data_post_processing">Profile data

</dd>

<p>
Hint: for most of the above commands, one just needs to prefix them with
"d" (or "dsp" when using full command names) to do similar operation on
the DSP.

<h3 id="readline">Command line editing and libreadline</h3>

<p>
Hatari debugger is much nicer to use with the command line history,
editing and especially the completion support for the command, command
argument and symbol names. Like many other programs (Bash etc),
debugger uses libreadline to handle this.
</p>


<h4>Hatari building</h4>
<p>
If you are building Hatari yourself, please make sure that you have
the GNU readline development files installed (on Debian / Ubuntu these
come from the "libreadline*-dev" packages). Otherwise the name
completion and other features don't get enabled when you configure
Hatari.
</p>


<h4>Keyboard shortcuts</h4>

<p>
In addition to the normal line editing keys, libreadline supports
several keyboard shortcuts ('^' indicates Control-key):
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Cursor movement (sometimes preferable over using arrow keys):</li>
 <ul>
   <li>^B - backward</li>
   <li>^F - forward</li>
   <li>^arrow - move by word</li>
   <li>^A - start of line</li>
   <li>^E - end of line</li>
   <li>^P - previous line</li>
   <li>^N - next line</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Cut / paste (relative to cursor position):</li>
 <ul>
   <li>^W - cut previous word (space separated)</li>
   <li>^K - cut ("kill") to end of line</li>
   <li>^U - cut to start of line</li>
   <li>^Y - paste ("yank") deleted content</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Other text changes:</li>
 <ul>
   <li>^D - delete character</li>
   <li>^T - transpose (switch) last 2 characters</li>
   <li>^_ - undo last change</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Miscanellous:</li>
 <ul>
   <li>^R - history ("reverse") search</li>
   <li>^L - clear screen and redraw line</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p>
(Above shortcuts are inherited from Emacs text editor, and work also
in all shells using readline.  See "man readline" on how to configure
them.)
