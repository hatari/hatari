  providing up to date Hatari binaries for Linux and Windows in 32
  and 64 bit mode. Very useful for end users wishing to try the devel
  versions of Hatari, and lots of interesting build logs too for
  various cpu architectures. See http://antarctica.no/~hatari/latest
  He also provided a patch for fixing compilation problems on macOS.

- Max Böhm: host <-> Atari filename encoding conversion routines and
  related changes needed to gemdos.c.

- Troed Sångberg (Troed of Sync): accurate description of the GLUE state
  machine for STF/STE in all wakestates (display signal, sync signal, ...)
  and the resulting lines' length used in overscan / hardscroll. Coder
  of the '{Closure}' demo which makes huge use of these techniques.
  He also provided patches for Audio Sculpture's custom IKBD program
  and MacOS screenshot dir handling.

- Thorsten Otto: improvements to the code that patches the TOS ROMs,
  Pure-C long symbol names, a.out symbol table & absolute symbols support,
  few debugger & tracing usability improvements, fixed (sin, mulaw & a-law)
  DSP ROM tables, fmovem test program, key mapping improvement.

 Code from other projects
 ------------------------

As a true open source project, Hatari also uses some code from other
projects which we would like to acknowledge here:

- Hatari binary releases include latest version of EmuTOS:
  https://emutos.sourceforge.io/

- Most of the original ST hardware emulation came from the WinSTon
  source code which has been written by Paul Bates.
  (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/winston/)

- The original CPU core has been taken from UAE which has been written
  by Bernd Schmidt and others. (http://uae.coresystems.de/)

- The current CPU & FPU cores have been taken from WinUAE which is
  maintained by Toni Wilen. Huge thanks to Toni for accepting ideas
  and patches not specific to Amiga emulation, as well as keeping on
  improving the accuracy of 68000/20/30 CPU and FPUs.
  (http://www.winuae.net/)

- Parts of the NCR 5380 SCSI emulation are based on code from WinUAE, too.

- Some parts have been taken from the emulator STonX that has been
  written by Marinos Yannikos and Martin Griffiths.
  (http://stonx.sourceforge.net/)

- A lot of code (e.g. the scancode keyboard mapping, Videl, NVRAM, SCC
  and DSP emulation) has been adapted from the sources of the emulator
  Aranym. (http://aranym.atari.org/)

- The code for decompressing ZIP files (unzip.c) has been taken from
  Gilles Vollant's miniunzip program.
  (http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/unzip.html)

- The routines for saving and loading the ASCII configuration file
  (cfgopts.c) have originally been written by Jeffry J. Brickley.

- The new sound core uses (or used) some code/ideas from the following GPL
  projects :
  * 5 bits volume table and 16*16*16 combinations of all volume are
    from Sc68 by Benjamin Gerard.
  * 4 bits to 5 bits volume interpolation from 16*16*16 to 32*32*32
    are from YM blep synthesis by Antti Lankila.
  * Since Hatari 1.7, volume table based on measures by Paulo Simoes

- The IDE hard disk emulation is based on code from QEMU.
  (http://www.qemu.org/)

- The MMU emulation for the 68030 has been taken from the NeXT emulator
  Previous (thanks to Andreas Grabher!). Since Hatari 1.9, this is now
  taken from WinUAE which uses the same code base.
