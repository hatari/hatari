                                   --------
                                Release Notes

Following features are deprecated and will be removed in a future release:
- SDL 2.x "bUseSdlRenderer" config and "GPU scaling" GUI options
  (after HW support for SDL2 is available widely enough)
- Hatari XBios(255) API enabled with the "--bios-intercept" option
  (i.e. use "--natfeats" & "--cmd-fifo" options and "hconsole" instead)
- The old ~/.hatari configuration file location (use ~/.config/hatari instead)
- Less flexible command FIFO / remote socket API command variants:
  - "hatari-shortcut screenshot" (use "hatari-debug screenshot <file>")
  - "hatari-shortcut coldreset"  (use "hatari-debug reset soft")
  - "hatari-shortcut warmreset"  (use "hatari-debug reset hard")
  - "hatari-shortcut savemem"    (use "hatari-debug statesave <file>")
  - "hatari-shortcut quit"       (use "hatari-debug quit [exit value]")
- The "--disable-small-mem" configuration option (small mem is enabled
  by default already and will be the only option soon)


 Development version
 -------------------

Removed features:
- The "--bpp" command line option and related code (i.e. the rendering
  functions for 16 bits-per-pixel host screens) have been removed
  since almost all recent hardware should support 32 bpp nowadays

Configuration changes:
- In hatari.cfg, section [RS232], rename:
  - sSccBOutFileName => SccBOutFileName
  - bEnableSccB => EnableSccB

Emulation improvements:
- MFP:
  - When IRQ is cleared on one of the 2 ACIAs, do not clear IRQ on
    the MFP side if the IRQ is still set on the other ACIA
- Blitter:
  - Ignore byte accesses to blitter registers defined as word only
- TT/DMA:
  - Update sound FIFO on each HBL (like on STE)
- CPU:

  - STE joypad emulation now supports analog / paddle input, too
- FDC:
  - For IPF/CTR support, caps library has a bug that resets FDC's TR and DR
    on warm reset (68000's reset command). We keep/restore the value ourselves
- IDE:
  - Fixed emulation of the HOB (High Order Byte) of the last LBA48 value
  - LBA28 capacity announcement is now correctly limited to 2^28-1

    based on Videl's registers $FF82C0 (VCO) and $FF82A2 (VFT) (was only 50 Hz before)

Emulator improvements:
- TOS:
  - Fix: set TOS country code from CountryCode setting, not Language one

    very long and contain almost any characters)
  - "<name>.sym" file beside program file acts as its symbols override
  - Add optional argument for "symbols <name|code|data>" commands,
    to limit listed symbols to ones with the given substring
  - Improved support for weak symbols (important for C++ code)
  - Symbols with duplicate addresses are skipped on symbols loading
- Disassembler:
  - Fix: CPU core disassembler crashes with longer symbol names
  - When entering debugger with 'history' enabled, disassembly address
    defaults to an address in history preceding the PC register value
    (to give more context than disassembling directly from PC)
  - Support for disassembly output options working also for CPU core
    disassembler, in addition to external disassember output
  - More flags to change the disassembly output for CPU core
    (upper/lower case, show memory content, show EA, ...)
  - The built-in "external" disassembler has been replaced by a
    disassembler provided by the Capstone library (version >= 4.0)
- Debugger:
  - Fix: free all debugger allocations before exit

Tools:
- gst2ascii:
  - Support for new MINT+ELF symbols
  - "-o" option is split to "-f" and "-g" options
  - "-s" option to skip symbols with duplicate addresses
  - By default filters same symbols out as Hatari debugger
  - This can be reverted with new '+' option variants (+l +g +s)
  - More concise listing of the duplicate symbols
- Profile data post-processor:
  - Does not show (most) of symbol conflict messages any more
    (unless '--verbose' option is given)

 --------------------------

Emulation improvements:
- Sound:
  - Much more precise function to convert CPU clocks to YM2149 clocks
    in the case where YM2149 doesn't use the same source clock as the CPU
    (fixes e.g. some STE sound glitches in BLSPLAY.TTP)

    option is set
- Misc:
  - Fix memory leaks on PNG save and GEMDOS HD program load

- Debugger:
  - Fix: to duplicate symbol name removal
  - Fix: all IDE trace output did not go to trace file
  - Like with rest of debugger, profiler responses go
    now to stderr (not stdout)

 Version 2.4.0 (2022-07-09)
 --------------------------

Removed features (that were marked as deprecated in earlier releases):
- Support for the SDL 1.2 library (i.e. SDL 2.x should be used instead)
- Support for building Hatari for Windows CE has been removed, too, since
  this was relying on version 1.2 of the SDL library.
- The old UAE CPU core (i.e. the new WinUAE CPU core is now always used)
- Python v2 support in Python scripts (Python 2 was end of life in 2020)

Emulation improvements:
- Internal timers:
  - Rewrite the internal timers used to emulate delays/events/mfp timers
    (gain ~10% on average, up to 60% in very specific cases)
- CPU:
  - Improve FPU emulation (exceptions, unimplemeted instructions, fsincos)
  - Improve FPU emulation in softfloat mode
  - Improve IPL timing update in various opcodes
  - Faster emulation of 68000 in cycle exact mode (gain ~7%)
- MFP:
  - Use the new internal timers for MFP timers
  - Improve accuracy when reading MFP's Timer Data Register
  - More accurate emulation by processing all internal timers first before
    reading/writing any MFP register (was previously delayed after processing
    the current CPU instruction, which was too late in some cases)
- Video:
 - Fix position for detecting when VBLANK should be disabled in 50 Hz and 60 Hz
- DSP:
  - Improved interrupts handling and SSI (from Previous NeXT emulator)
- Sound:
  - Improve accuracy of YM2149's sample generation by using the main
    CPU clock as a reference for all timings (syncsquare effect as used
    in recent maxYMiser v1.53)
  - Use specific memory functions when doing DMA for STE and Falcon sound
    (don't generate bus error when pointed memory is not present)
  - Improve value of MFP GPIP bit 7 for DMA sound in the case of STE/TT
    (video mono XOR dma sound xsint)
  - Use 2 different signals SOUNDINT and SNDINT for Falcon (connected to
    MFP GPIP7 and MFP Timer A input)

  - Support 1024k EmuTOS images also on TT & Falcon
  - Add country code option to select EmuTOS language, keyboard
    layout and screen refresh rate on Mega/ST/STe machines (ones
    lacking NVRAM)
- MIDI support:
  - Fix: PortMidi rejects Hatari MIDI events
  - Fix: MIDI IRQ needs to be re-enabled on MIDI device change
    even when there's no reset
  - Support for matching PortMidi device name by prefix when
    there's no exact full match
- RS232:
  - The RS232 receiver code has been rewritten to use polling instead
    of using a thread. This should avoid deadlocks on BSD/macOS systems
    when shutting down or reconfiguring the RS232 settings.
- TT/Falcon:
  - Increase max TT-RAM amount to 1024 MiB
  - Separate config + CLI options to override NVRAM language and
    keyboard layout settings

  - Correct also smaller specified memory amounts to valid ones
  - Microphone emulation now uses SDL2 instead of PortAudio
- MegaSTE/TT:
  - Add VME/SCU registers "--vme <none|dummy>" access option
    (Linux needs "none" option and TOS v2 / v3 need "dummy" one
    until Hatari implements real VME/SCU register emulation)
- VDI mode:
  - Relax VDI mode width alignment from 128/planes to
    16/planes, and height alignment from 16 to 8 pixels
- SDL GUI:
  - Fix: ignore unrecognized events in file selector
    (buttons could be incorrectly shown as selected)

    and prevent user seeing invalid VDI mode sizes
  - Fine-tune CPU dialog texts and keyboard shortcuts
- GEMDOS HD:
  - Fix: clear GEMDOS Fread / Fwrite errors
  - Fix: Allow GEMDOS tasks to use other tasks' file handles
- Command line:
  - Support "off" as alias for "none" when disabling DSP, FPU,
    Joysticks and VME, for consistency with HW on/off options
- NatFeats:
  - Fix: freeze with NF_STDERR when string is empty or unterminated
- Debugger:
  - Fix: profile header so that profile data post-processor knows how
    to parse built-in WinAUE CPU core ("uae") disassembly output, not
    just "ext" disassembler output
  - Repeat CPU & DSP "step" and "next" commands on Enter
  - Output PC location in CPU & DSP disassembly
  - More readable "variables" command output
  - Add "PConSymbol" variable for breaking on symbol addresses
  - Add "mmu" and "vme" options for "info" command

  - "next subreturn" will run until current function returns,
    even if function calls other functions before that
  - Symbol loadind code is now shared between debugger "symbols"
    command & "gst2ascii" tool, and it can now read also long
    symbol names from Pure-C debug information
  - Auto-detection for whether section offsets should be used
    when loading symbol information
  - MIDI trace options are split to "midi" (device & MIDI events)
    and "midi_raw" (IRQ and register read/write access).  Trace
    logging added also for MIDI byte writes, not just reads
  - Trace options are listed in alphabetical order
  - Show loaded symbols in CPU core disassembly
- Windows:
  - Next/prev drive change buttons added to SDL GUI file select dialog

Build/configure:
- SMALL_MEM option is enabled by default

Tools:
- Add (SDL2 specific) "listkeys" key mapping helper back
- TOS boot tester: support 1024k EmuTOS images, misc fixes

Documentation:
- Compatibility updates, especially for 060 programs that need
  FPSP060.PRG for missing instructions emulation

Fixed demos:
- Hackabonds Demo (wrong vblank detection)
- We Were @ HD version under GEMDOS HD (file handle access)

Fixed programs:
- maxYMiser FM v1.53 by gwEn (support for syncsquare effect)

Fixed games:
- Chambers of Shaolin : DMA sound was wrong in STE mode with 1 MB RAM
  (mfp gpip bit 7)
- Super Hang On : fix flickering raster colors (bclr #0,$fffffa0f sometimes
  happened at the same time timer C expired)


 Version 2.3.1 (2020-12-27)

  (DSP hostport PORTB interrupt handling)
- Several demos (Cruor 96k, Hmmm..., Keff, Payback 2015) and games
  (Beats of Rage, Capy, Confusion preview 2, Men at War preview,
  Moonspeeder preview 2, Neurobot, Pacmania X68000, Slippery Sam
  and Sokoban by Fun) not starting with TOS4 or EmuTOS unless MMU
  was enabled (unneeded extra prefetch in movem)
- Built-in Obsolescence demo, Delmpaint app and Sidetracked GFA

  (unneeded extra prefetch in movem)


 Version 2.3.0 (2020-11-28)
 --------------------------

Emulation:
- FDC / Disk :
  - Support for MegaSTE DIP switch register $FF9200
    (set floppy drive to HD by default on MegaSTE/TT/Falcon)
  - support for DD/HD mode on MegaSTE at $FF860E
    (when FDC is set to HD mode, reading DD floppies will fail)
  - Support for the 'Disk Change' (DC) signal on TT machines on TT's MFP GPIP4
  - Fix: IDE disks with sector size > 512 bytes
  - Fix: IDE controller is now always available in Falcon mode, even if
    no hard disks have been configured.
- CPU:
  - Update CPU core to latest WinUAE 4.4.0 beta : full support for
    undocumented fields in 68000 bus/address error stack frames, as well as
    CCR flags for most of the 680x0 instructions (using a cpu tester program
    on the real hardware that checks all possible opcodes' combinations)
  - 68030 MMU hardware bus error support + various fixes
  - FPU fixes
- Video:
  - Improved timing when setting Vsync signal
    (same place where video counter is reloaded)
  - Handle screen where vertical DE signal is completely disabled
  - Better start/end position for the VBlank signal at 50Hz and 60Hz
- Sound:
  - Add a better filter for downsampling the internal 250 kHz signal, should
    give better results when the YM2149 outputs high frequency sounds
  - Fix microwire mask shifting when CPU runs > 8 MHz
- MFP :
  - Rewrite MFP code to handle several MFP objects and add support
    for the TT's 2nd MFP (not all TT's MFP signals are emulated yet)
  - Improved Falcon's DMA sound interrupt on GPIP7 and AER
- Blitter:
  - Large rewrite of the blitter's core, improving cycle accuracy and
    handling the complex cases where xcount=1 and nfsr=1. Code is slightly
    smaller and closer to the logic of the real hardware
  - Handle restart in non HOG mode when the CPU uses a RMW instruction
    (eg TAS)
  - Improve access to memory regions that would generate a bus error
    for the CPU
- Emulate additional RTC/NVRAM registers
- megaSTE should start at 8 MHz, not 16 MHz

Emulator:
- Miscellaneous:
  - Fix: freeze at Hatari exit and RS-232 device file changes,
    when device file(s) are FIFO(s)
  - Fix: when autostarting programs without pre-existing INF file,
    enable blitter also with EmuTOS
  - Use floppy track's size in bytes to detect DD/HD/ED
    (instead of counting sectors)
  - Add --lilo debug option for more convenient m68k Linux loading
- Config file handling:
  - Support config file values with '=' in them
  - Skip reading global config file if HATARI_TEST environment
    variable is set
- Memory handling:
  - Memory snapshot version increase due to FDC changes
    (i.e. old snapshots won't work with new version)
  - Accept 10MB as valid ST-RAM amount (max on real MegaSTE/TT machines)
    and correct invalid Falcon ST-RAM amounts
  - Fix: 24-bit address mode change while emulation is running
    (triggered e.g. when TT-RAM is enabled for TT)
- HD images:
  - Fix: run-time IDE byte swap change requires IDE re-init
  - Fix: TOS booting from A: although SCSI drive was enabled
  - Support read-only HD image files, and show error dialogs
    for image file open/lock issues
- GEMDOS HD emulation:
  - Support FASTLOAD program flag with GEMDOS HD
  - GEMDOS HD emulation cartridge assembly functionality is moved almost
    completely to emulator side. Fixes Atari side error handling when program
    file is not readable, and TOS stack overflows in some rare cases
  - Detect DTA re-use to reduce DTA cache usage, grow cache on
    demand and give warning if its entries need to be re-cycled
    (= cache max size is reached)
  - Invalid DTA in Fsnext() return -ENMFIL, like TOS does
  - Fix: skip non-existing host files on FSnext() instead
    of returning an error (latter broke directory listings)
  - Fix: Dsetpath/Dgetpath empty path handling
- Hatari graphics support:
  - Low/med-rez line doubling uses less CPU and doubled lines in
    "TV" display mode are now drawn at half intensity, not as black
    (fixes TV mode being too dark)
  - SDL2: "--zoom" option accepts any values between 1.0 - 8.0
  - SDL2: "--zoom" option is changed to always enable low resolution
    doubling before SDL framebuffer is scaled up (or down) by the zoom
    factor. This way Hatari output window is approximately same sized
    regardless of emulated Atari resolution, like on a real CRT monitor
  - SDL2: scale quality is selected automatically; nearest pixel for sharp
    output with integer scaling factors, and linear scaling to smooth out
    issues with non-integer scaling and window resizes
  - SDL2: Now redundant "nRenderScaleQuality" config option is
    removed and "Linear scaling" option in GUI is replaced with
    the "GPU scaling" option (=bUseSdlRenderer config option)
  - Added new "--screenshot-dir" option to select the folder for screenshots
  - Fix: [ffmpeg/video] Invalid PNG signature 0x89504E470D0A1A
  - Fix: garbage graphics (by clearing the whole render area)
  - Fix: Spec512_StoreCyclePalette when using 16 or 32 MHz
- Input handling:
  - Support SDL "Hat" events in addition to "Axes" events
    (= support 80's game controllers, also in SDL GUI)
  - Map a turbofire button independent of the fire button if the game
    controller is capable
  - Show mouse grab toggle shortcut key in startup statusbar message
  - Center host mouse to Hatari window on Atari resets and resolution
    changes only when window is focused and mouse pointer is within it
  - Fix: keypad emulation with SDL2
  - Fix: simulated (socket API) key input with SDL2
- Profiler:
  - Profiler backtrace shows now real caller addresses
    and their offsets from the function entry points
    (slows profiling of addresses with symbols)
  - All profiler outputs have now reasonable limits
    (so that they don't flood console)
  - Fix: exception in profile post-processor script
    (with symbol address aliases)
- Tracing:
  - Fix: CPU disassembly trace output doesn't go to specified trace file
  - Trace flags can be added and removed instead of needing to
    always specify all the relevant ones, both with "--trace"
    command line option and debugger "trace" command:
    --trace os_base,aes, trace +xbios,bios, trace -bios,-aes
  - VDI trace shows names also for NVDI/Speedo/GDOS functions
  - VDI & AES trace function numbers are shown in hexadecimals
    with 0x prefix like rest of the OS calls
- Debugger:
  - New "screenshot" command for saving screen dump to a PNG/BMP file
  - "symbols resident" option replaced with "symbols autoload"
    option which can be used to completely disable automatic symbol
    loading and unloading for programs run through the GEMDOS HD
    (helps debugging resident programs started from GEMDOS HD)
  - Improvements to UAE and external disassembler disassembly
  - UAE disassembler is now default instead of external one
    (latter doesn't decode all instructions correctly)
  - New "info" subcommands:
    "acia", "dmasnd", "ikbd", "mfp", "nvram", "rtc" and "scc"
  - Also UAE disassembler can now show the profile info
  - "info" command can show AES & VDI information on on their
    respective traps without VDI mode/tracing being enabled
  - Breakpoint ":info" option to call specified info function
    on tracing breakpoint hits (one can now use e.g. ":info vdi"
    on VdiOpcode breakpoints)

  - When Hatari resets or exits due to emulated program
    NF_SHUTDOWN / NF_EXIT call, output user a note about that

Tools and Hatari Python/Gtk UI:
- Python scripts use now "python3" because most current distros don't
  anymore install Python v2 by default.  To use a script with v2,
  change "python3" in its first line to "python2"

Building and unit tests:

  - Fix: release mouse in all cases where debugger can be invoked
  - Fix: DSP disassembler didn't in all cases show illegal opcodes correctly
  - Fix: "symbols" command crash when it was used during TOS bootup
  - Fix: TOS and cartridge addresses weren't (with all TOS versions)
    in address order which asserted in profile data post-processor
  - Fix: "next" command didn't work correctly in "hex" number base
  - Fix: depending on compiler/linker/assembler, DATA/BSS debug symbol
    offsets can in programs be either relative to their own, or to TEXT
    section start.  If former fails, try latter when loading symbols.
  - New "ym" info subcommand to show YM register values
  - "quit" command by-passes exit confirmation dialog and takes
    an optional Hatari exit code value
  - removed limits on breakpoints and their conditions
  - when entering debugger, current program's DRI/GST format debug
    symbols are automatically read from it, if such are available
  - new --debug-except option to specify which exceptions invoke
    the debugger, and WinUAE CPU core support for -D toggle option
  - "next"/"dspnext" commands work like in other debuggers, they
    skip subroutine/exception calls, for all other instructions
    they works like "step" command (earlier they always moved to
    next instruction in memory)
  - "next" and "dspnext" commands support optional "instruction type"
    argument, which can be used (for example) to continue emulation
    until subroutine returns
  - "history" command takes optional parameter specifying how many
    instructions of history will be tracked
  - CPU & DSP profile commands have now subcommand for profiling loops
  - "CpuInstr" and "DspInstr" variables for count of instructions
    executed since emulation was last continued from debugger
  - In addition to "!" condition, also "<" and ">" conditions can store

    With above change, this can be e.g. used to detect and profile
    what are worst frames in games and why
  - New "rename" command to rename files.  Useful for scripted
    worst frame and spinloop profiling
  - Address space in 'dm' command can be given like in DSP disassembly,
    "dm x:$100", in addition to earlier "dm x $100" syntax
  - Fix out of bounds memory access that could result in bad disassembly
    output when using the external disassembler (only "dc.w" were printed)

Tools:
- Increased max partition size in atari-hd-image script to 512MB.
- New hatari_spinloop.py script for post-processing loop profile data.
  It can tell how many times loops were executed, how many times they
  spinned at minimum and maximum, at which VBL those happened, and what
  was the standard deviation of that.
- gst2ascii supports now both section relative and TEXT section relative
  DATA/BSS symbol offsets

 Version 1.7.0 (2013-06-24):
 ---------------------------

Emulation:
- TT video emulation :
  - Extend the ST palette registers from 9bit to 12bit for ST modes
  - Duochrome mode instead of monochrome for ST High
  - Implementation of SampleHold in TT Hypermono video mode
- Sound changes :
  - Better model of the YM2149 noise generation (no noticeable audible impact)
  - Slightly better volume table (measured by Paulo Simoes on a real ST)
- CPU changes :
  - Added experimental MMU emulation for the 68030 mode
  - Handle the IACK cycles during an exception for HBL/VBL
- ACIA/IKBD changes :
  - Full implementation of the MC6850 ACIA, giving much more robust
    IKBD emulation
  - Better timings for all IKBD commands (measured on a real STF)
  - Clock is handled internally in IKBD, host date/time is used
    only to initialize RTC at boot.  I.e. pausing emulation doesn't
    cause time skips when unpausing
  - Fix slow mouse when absolute mode is used with scale values
- MFP changes :
  - Fixed priority errors when simultaneous interrupts happened
  - MFP's IRQ should be delayed by 4 cycles before reaching the CPU
  - MFP's IRQ signal was not correctly updated in some cases
  - Handle the IACK cycles between CPU and MFP during an exception
- FDC changes :
  - Better delays for all the GAPs inside a track
  - Emulate the disk's rotation and its angular position to get
    accurate delays when accessing a sector header
  - Internal timer for FDC was wrong and sometimes slower than expected
  - Correct delay for type I commands with "verify" bit=1
- GEMDOS HD emulation changes :
  - Support Fforce() for GEMDOS HD emulated files and close at Pterm*()
    all internal handles to emulated files program had left open
  - Fix: cut file and dir names to 8+3 chars like all TOS versions do
  - Fix: GEMDOS HD emulation overwrote last 28 bytes of basepage space
    for the started process command line (with the program header)
  - Fix: Fwrite() content wasn't flushed to disk on each write, so later
    Fopen() + Fread()s calls on such files (if they were not closed
    in the meanwhile) could get data that was out of date.
  - Fix: Dfree() return value

Emulator:
- Fix: problems with run-time CPU type changing
- Fix: MIDI IRQs were not enabled if MIDI was enabled at run-time.
  MIDI toggling will now imply reset
- Much improved console redirection functionality and a separate --conout
  option for it (--bios-intercept doesn't anymore imply console redirection)
- Fixed a bug with the axes' mapping in the joystick's detection
- Display handling:
  - Fix: max resolution limit wasn't handled properly for ST mode.
  - Don't change TOS-calculated font size for VDI mode.
  - Setup NVRAM video mode based on VDI mode, when in VDI mode.
    This makes VDI mode work with EmuTOS also under Falcon emulation
    which is useful as EmuTOS doesn't support native VIDEL expanders
  - Limit VDI screen memory usage to 300kB, this allows up to 2048x1200
    monochrome and 1024x600/800x768 16-color VDI screens
- GEMDOS HD emulation:
  - Fix: to DTA host filename cutting to 8+3 chars when whole filename
    was < 12 chars (caused EmuTOS crash)
  - Give warning if GEMDOS dir/file path exceeds 8+3 characters
    (as those won't work with real TOS)
  - New --gemdos-case option to specify whether new dir/filenames
    are forced to be created in upper (default) or lower case
  - Giving empty string as GEMDOS HD dir disables GEMDOS HD emulation
- SDL GUI:
  - Fileselector has "CWD" button for changing to Hatari's work directory
  - Fileselector remembers previous position which is nicer with
    large directories
  - Make the drive leds blink with a brighter green when the FDC is executing
    a command
- Profiler:
  - Fix: profiler assert on invalid PC register values
  - Fix: profiler usage in debugger files invoked by breakpoints
  - Fix: profiler CPU & DSP cycles information is for previous instruction
  - Fix: WinUAE CPU requires cycles counter usage for getting current
    CPU instruction cycles
  - Profiler provides timing information, based on used cycles
  - Profiler provides CPU instruction cache misses information when using
    cycle-exact WinUAE CPU core (which is Falcon emu default)
  - Profiler top instruction count/cycles/misses lists show
    the related instructions
  - For DSP, profiler adds min/max cycle difference info to disassembly
  - New "addresses" subcommand can be used to see addresses through which
    code passed during profiling (e.g. while program seems frozen, this
    gives much better overview of code that is being run, than cpu trace)
  - New "callers" subcommand lists all addresses from which loaded
    symbols' addresses were "called" from.  This way one can e.g. find
    in which contexts interrupt handlers were called and it can be
    used to construction program execution callgraph
  - New "save" subcommand saves profile address and caller information
    to given file, with extra information needed for post-processing
  - New "stack" subcommand that can be used to get backtraces during
    profiling with symbols, for ':noinit' backtraces
- Debugger:
  - New ':noinit' and ':quiet' breakpoint options.  Quiet option
    removes most of breakpoint matching "noise" and ':noinit' breakpoints
    can be used with "profile stack" command, to prevent profile data and
    related callstack information from being reset on breakpoint match
  - "blitter" and "dsp" subcommand added to "info" command, to show
    blitter register values and DSP state (e.g. stack content)
  - "prg" subcommand added to "symbols" command, for loading debug
    symbols from DRI/GST symbol table in last started program
  - "step" and "next" commands added for single stepping CPU and DSP code
    -> 's' shortcut is now for "step", not "save"
  - "--disasm" option for selecting between UAE core and external CPU
    code disassembler and setting output option flags for latter
  - When -D option is used, also undefined/illegal DSP instructions and
    DSP stack under/overflows invoke debugger, not just CPU issues
  - Fix: when several breakpoints should have triggered
         on the same address, only first was handled
  - Fix: after breakpoint, 'c <n>' continues one instruction too little
  - Fix: tracking breakpoint values were updated only when all conditions
    matched, now they can be also used together with other conditions
  - Fix: info command crash (triggered on NetBSD)
  - Fix: disassember output bug on NetBSD (unsigned char < -1 test)
  - Fix: info osheader and basebase subcommands under MiNT
  - Fix: debugger history duplicates removal
  - Fix: expression expanding CPU "pc" for DSP shortcut commands
  - Fix: expression expansion messing lines in command line history
  - Remote API debugger commands can also use expression expansion
  - Both single and double quotes can be used to mark expressions
  - In addition to text section offset, data and bss section offsets
    can be given when loading symbols (useful for Devpac symbols)
  - Output what value was set by options if it's not otherwise shown by UI
  - New 'cpu' and 'dsp' options to 'history' command for tracing just
    one of these processors on Falcon
  - Function arguments are shown in traces for all non-MiNT GEMDOS calls
    and subset of arguments are now shown also for AES calls (values in
    intin array and strings in addrin array)
  - Add NVRAM read & write tracing
  - Support for the basic Native Features and --natfeats option to control it:
    http://wiki.aranym.org/natfeats/proposal

Windows specific changes:
- "-W" option added for opening a console window.  Like on all other platforms,
  "-D" will now just toggle CPU exception handling
- Fix: console stderr redirection (used invalid "wr" mode)
- Fix Windows localtime() not supporting dates before 1970:
  - TOS not being able to access files with such dates, or further files
  - causing IKBD emulation crashes (wasn't problem with Cygwin,
    just with Mingw builds)

Tool updates:
- New hatari-profiler.py script for post-processing output from
  profiler's CPU and DSP profiling "save" commands:
	profile save <filename>
	dspprofile save <filename>
  - With symbol address information it can provide function level
    instruction, processor cycle & i-cache miss statistics
  - With callers information it can create function call callgraphs
    and create callgrind format files for Kcachegrind GUI
- New gst2ascii tool to extract DRI/GST symbol table from Atari program,
  for use with the profile data post-processor
- Added scripts for converting symbol tables in Devpac 3 listings and DSP LOD
  files to a format understood by Hatari debugger 'symbols' command,
  and to clean 'nm' output of GCC & VBCC built a.out binaries for it

Other changes:
- HTML documentation indices generated dynamically with JS
- Debugger tests building fixed

 ---------------------------

The Hatari project has been moved from hatari.berlios.de to
http://hatari.tuxfamily.org/. Please update all bookmarks!

Emulation:
- More accurate FDC emulation (correct status bits and commands' timings,
  DMA transfer by blocks of 16 bytes, floppy change detection). This should
  fix a lot of non working games
- More accurate microwire clock emulation
- SCSI class 1 (ICD) command support for drives > 1 GB
- Improved color conversion table so that colors are a little bit brighter
- Improve shifter (add another method to do 4 pixel hardware scrolling,
    better emulation for 0 byte blank line)
- Some fixes to the IKBD emulation
- Better filters and model for sound emulation
- Correct VBL timings in TT monochrome (double clicking works now)
- More cycle accurate Falcon DSP <-> CPU emulation.  All the demos that
  needed 32Mhz CPU with the old CPU core in Hatari v1.5, work now at
  correct 16Mhz with the WinUAE CPU core
- 030 MMU emulation with the WinUAE CPU core


Emulator:
- Switch to ST mode when using TOS <= 1.04
- Replace "--slowfdc" with "--fastfdc" option and default to fast FDC being OFF
- "--fast-boot" option to initialize "memvalid" system variables to
  by-pass the memory test of TOS, so that the system boots faster
- "--force-max" option to force Hatari use specified maximum resolution
  to avoid window size changes messing up Hatari video recording
- "--desktop-st" option to keep desktop resolution also for ST/STE modes
  (unfortunately without scaling besides the low-res doubling)
- GEMDOS HD emulation:
  - Allow drives up to Z: (not Y:)
  - Unique name for each partition
  - Warn user when using too old TOS version
  - Dfree() reports host disk total and free size if they're below
    value understood by TOS and unlike earlier, it forwards Dfree()
    requests  for other (IDE/ACSI image) partitions to TOS
- Debugger improvements:
  - "history" command to list instructions executed before entering
    debugger
  - each trace output line is flushed to avoid it being buffered
- Fixed behavior of the Caps Lock key

Other changes:
- Fixes to Hatari UI Hatari window embedding
- Latest Linux sfdisk is borked so atari-hd-image script creates
  HD image partition table now itself (experimental)
- Windows needs also HOMEDRIVE for full home path in case Hatari
  isn't installed on C:, bug 18297
- Minor fixes

 Version 1.5.0 (2011-07-19):
 ---------------------------

Emulation:
- Alternative CPU core based on WinUAE for more accurate future
  HW interaction emulation (see readme.txt on how to enable it)
- Use precise clocks values (as described in Atari's official schematics)
  for better video/dma audio synchronisation (e.g. More Or Less Zero by DHS)
- DSP:
  - Some DSP-timing sensitive Falcon demos that by luck happened to work
    with Hatari v1.4, don't work anymore in v1.5 with the default UAE CPU
    core.  This is because while DSP cycle accuracy has been improved,
    the default UAE CPU core isn't fully cycle accurate.  The experimental
    WinUAE core is needed to run them
  - Undocumented 2 bit shift special case for DSP SSI <-> crossbar exchanges
    in handshake mode with 32 Mhz clock (fixes DSP MP2 player used in many
    demos & programs, but that requires also using WinUAE core)
- Sound improvements:
  - Major rewrite and accuracy improvements in STE DMA sound, including
    emulation of the 8 bytes FIFO, giving results nearly identical to
    a real STE (e.g. HexTracker by Paulo Simoes)
  - Improved precision in sound emulation, with nearly no rounding errors
    over successive VBL (correct sound latency on US TOS running at 60 Hz)
  - By default mix 3 YM voices using a lookup table of values
    measured on real STF to improve digisound (e.g. Flashback demo sound)
  - Remove old ST Sound's code used for tone and noise step compute
    (some low period values were not correctly emulated)
- Video emulation on STF/STE:
  - On STE, correctly shift display 8 pixels to the left when using
    224 bytes overscan
  - Add support for spec512 mode in med res (fixes 'Best Part Of The
    Creation' in 'Punish Your Machine', 'HighRes Mode' demo by Paradox)
  - Correctly shift the screen 4 pixels to the left when left border is removed
    in med res overscan (Hatari 1.4 handled only low res, fixes 'No Cooper'
    by 1984, 'Best Part Of The Creation' by Delta Force)
  - Precisely emulate the number of frames per sec (eg 50.053 fps in PAL
    instead of the usual 50 Hz)

Emulator:
- Atari program given as argument to Hatari will be automatically
  started after TOS boots. GEMDOS hard disk directory can now be
  give also as an argument, not just as a (-d) option
- TOS4 or --machine falcon option use enables DSP emulation now
  (follow them with --dsp none to disable DSP emulation)
- Memory state saving and restoring fixes, especially for Falcon
  - Crossbar state is included -> state file ABI break
- AVI recording options can be set in the new [Video] config file section
- AVI recording supports non integer frame rates.
- Falcon/TT Videl/hostscreen improvements:
  - New setting/option for using Desktop resolution & scaling
    in fullscreen instead of changing the resolution. On by default
  - User's desktop size is used as max limit for Videl zooming.
    Requires SDL >= 1.2.10
  - Videl resolution change is done immediately, not 3 VBLs late
  - Fix issues in switching between same sized VDI & TT resolutions
- SDL GUI improvements:
  - DSP can be disabled from the GUI without needing to restart Hatari
  - Disk access LED and desktop-resolution options
  - AVI video length (mins:secs) is shown in titlebar during recording
  - Option for cropping statusbar from videos & screenshots
  - Fileselector scrollbar can be used with mouse
  - YM mixing method selection
- Debugging improvements:
  - New disassembler with more Motorola like syntax
  - CPU & DSP "disasm" and "memdump" commands accept register & symbol
    names in addition to numeric addresses / address ranges
  - Option to disable Falcon mic
    ("--mic off" is needed for Mudflap debugging)
  - "--run-vbls" can be set also at run-time
  - "--bios-intercept" can be toggled from debugger (not just enabled)
  - BIOS CON: output is converted to ASCII and redirected to host console
    with the --bios-intercept option
  - Support for tracing DSP, Videl and Crossbar
  - Support for tracing AES calls.  VDI calls can now be traced
    also without using an extended VDI resolution
  - BIOS/XBIOS/GEMDOS/VDI/AES/Line-A/Line-F opcode breakpoint support
  - TEXT, DATA and BSS variables for addresses of corresponding segments
    in currently loaded program
  - "aes", "vdi" and "gemdos" subcommands for "info".  Without arguments
    they will output information about corresponding OS part state,
    with (a non-zero) argument, opcode/call name table is shown.
    "video" subcommand for showing video related information.
    "cookiejar" subcommand for showing cookiejar contents.
  - "file" subcommand to "lock" that executes debugger commands from
    given file when debugger is entered (or ":lock" breakpoint is hit)
  - ":lock" option to breakpoints that will show (without stopping the
    emulation) the same output as what's shown on entering the debugger
  - ":file" option to breakpoints that executes the commands from
    given file when the breakpoint is hit. This can be used to chain
    debugger actions
  - multiple breakpoints options can be specified per breakpoint
  - parenthesis in "evaluate" command are used to indicate memory
    accesses (instead of operator precedence like earlier)
  - DSP and CPU code profiling functionality.  Provides statistics about
    profiled code (executed code address ranges, max and total counts
    and cycles), lists addresses/instructions taking most cycles and if
    symbols are loaded, what were the most used symbol addresses.
  - Profiling information is also shown in disassembly output

Other changes:
- hmsa tool can create empty disk images in addition to converting
  disks between ST & MSA formats
- Minimal hatari-tos-register.sh Linux init script (example)
  to register Hatari as binfmt_misc handler/runner for TOS programs
- hatari-console.py renamed to hconsole.py, documented and made extensible
  (hconsole is command line Python interface for Hatari remote API)
- Support for plain Makefiles removed (except for internal tests),
  only CMake is used for configuring and building Hatari
- CMake doesn't require anymore working C++, C-compiler is enough


 Version 1.4.0 (2010-06-12):
 ---------------------------

Emulation:
- IDE improvements:
  - Support for second drive (IDE slave)
  - WIN_FORMAT command (allows HD Driver to format IDE drives)
- GEMDOS HDD emulation:
  - Minor fixes to Fseek(), Fopen(), Fdatime() (e.g. Pure debugger works)
  - On TOS v4 Fread() size arg is unsigned, on earlier TOS its signed
    (bad code can use -1L to read whole file instead getting fail on TOS4)
  - Prevent DTA and read/write functions accessing invalid memory areas
  - Programs can now change read-only files to be writable
- Falcon sound emulation:
  - Microphone (jack) emulation in Falcon mode (requires portaudio library)
  - SSI direct sound entrance ("Audio Fun Machine" and winrec are working)
  - DMA sound recording
  - Crossbar handshake mode transfers
- Max VDI rez increased to TT-hi size (1280x960)
- 68020+FPU changed to 68EC030+FPU (no MMU 030) for Falcon and TT modes
  (Some Falcon programs didn't work with 020)
- Video emulation on STF/STE:
  - correctly shift the screen 4 pixels to the left when left border is removed
  - add support for STE's 224 bytes overscan line without stabilizer
  - when reading $ff8205/07/09 on STE, take into account the value
    of horizontal scrolling/prefetch and linewidth
  - when writing to $ff8205/07/09 on STE, correctly handle the case
    where the write is made while display in ON
- LMC1992 emulation / STE sound filtering

Emulator:
- Host mouse is centered to Hatari window on Falcon resolution changes
  (helps in synchronizing host and emulated mouse positions)
- Toggling fullscreen doesn't unpause paused emulation
- Falcon/TT resolution zooming is now controlled by separate options for
  monitor aspect ratio correction and maximum zoomed Hatari window size.
  This can reduce Hatari window resolution size changes significantly and
  makes e.g. FUN's Alive demo viewable in fullscreen mode.  Limits for
  window size are also checked to see whether ST/STE low rez should be
  zoomed and how much of borders can be shown (when borders enabled)
- Split the Screen dialog into two separate dialogs, one for Atari
  monitor emulation setup and one for Hatari window setup
- GEMDOS drive emulation:
  - support long host directory names and much improved long filename support
  - convert host filename chars invalid in TOS to valid ones ('@')
  - use TOS filename matching instead of glob() (can match names with [])
- Options for preventing floppy image (--protect-floppy) and GEMDOS
  emulated drive directory (--protect-hd) modifications
- AVI file recording:
  - video can be stored as BMP or as PNG images
  - audio is stored as 16 bits stereo PCM
- Statusbar shows CPU type & speed
- Can create blank 2.88MB (ED) and 1.44MB (HD) floppy images
  from the GUI in addition to DD & SD images.  After creating
  new floppy image, one can directly insert it to A: or B:.
- Tracing for BIOS, XBIOS, GEMDOS and VDI traps gives in addition
  to the opcode, also the name of the corresponding OS function
- Major debugger improvements:
  - TAB-completion for debugger commands, command arguments and
    symbol names. Requires readline library
  - "parse" command and --parse Hatari command line option to
    execute debugger commands from a file
  - "stateload" and "statesave" commands for memory snapshots
  - "trace" command for tracing what the emulated code does
  - "symbols" command for loading and listing CPU & DSP code & data
    symbols/addresses.  Code symbols are shown on CPU & DSP disassembly
    and code & data symbols can be used in breakpoints
  - "evaluate" command for doing calculations. Register and symbol
    names in expressions are replaced by their values. '$' will be
    TAB-completed to last 'evaluate' command result
  - "cd" command to change Hatari work directory
  - "exec" command to execute shell commands (ENABLE_SYSTEM_DEBUG_CALL)
  - "info" command for showing Atari HW and OS information
  - "lock" command for setting what information is shown every time on
    entering the debugger, e.g. disassembly or memdump from given address.
    "regaddr" argument does that from address pointed by given register
  - improved register name handling + fixed DSP reg name matching
  - if both sides of conditional breakpoint condition are identical, replace
    right side with current value of given expression (e.g. if it's "d0",
    use current D0 value).  If the comparison is for inequality ("!"),
    output the value & break only when the value changes from the previous
    value (not original like with other comparisons).  Symbols support
  - ":trace" option to trace/output breakpoint hits without breaking
  - breakpoints count hits and can be optionally removed after first hit
    (":once" option) or triggered only on every Nth hit (":<count>" option)
  - dsp/address command is a shortcut for conditional breakpoints and its
    argument can be an expression (see "evaluate" above)
  - Display DSP instructions cycle timings in disasm mode (in cycles)
  - Configuration options for how many lines to disasm & memdump
- Fix VBLs/s counting to work also when --run-vbls isn't used

Other changes:
- Considerably expanded debugging and hard disk sections in manual
- CMake build support, this fixes OSX building and adds support
  for building Hatari in different directory from the sources
- Removed autotools usage/support, added CMake "configure" script
- Hatari remote control programs updates (see their own release notes
  for details)


 Version 1.3.1 (2009-09-05):

 Version 0.95 (2007-05-12):
 --------------------------

- This release brings you basic Atari TT and Falcon emulation!
  Please note that both new emulation modes are still highly experimental,
  some few games and demos work, but most still have more or less big
  problems.
- Basic emulation of Falcon video shifter (Videl), NVRAM and DMA sound is in
  place. The biggest drawback: There is no working Falcon DSP emulation yet.

  exactly the amount set up for Hatari.  Saves memory on embedded systems
  if less than 4MB is specified.)
- Re-written command-line option handling.
- (Again) lots of code const/static, type usage and indentation cleanup.
- Preliminary support for TOS 3.0x and 030 TT software that runs in ST
  resolutions and doesn't need PMMU.
- Native GUI for Mac OSX.
- ACSI emulation fixes to get HD formatting to work with AHDI 5. HD emulation
  now works quite fine with AHDI 5 (but other HD drivers are currently not
  supported).
- Joystick shortcut changed to toggle cursor emulation between ports 0 and 1.
- Keys for all Hatari shortcuts can now be configured from hatari.cfg.
- Added command line option for setting ST keyboard mapping.
- Joystick command line option requires now parameter for a port for which
  the joystick cursor emu is enabled.

 Version 0.50 (2004-07-26):
 --------------------------

- A lot of internal code cleanup and bug fixes.
- Added a dialog for creating new blank floppy disk images.
- The source code has been optimized for better emulation speed.
- Added RS232 emulation (still very experimental and not very well tested! It
  seems not to work reliable yet. Help for debugging is very appreciated!).
- Some bugs in the 68000 emulation have been fixed.
- The emulator now checks for double bus errors and stops the emulation if
  necessary (instead of crashing the emulator).
- Timer-D is now patched correctly again.
- The old font has been replaced by two new fonts so that the GUI now looks
  better in high resolutions.
- The fonts are now linked into the executable.
- Added support for DIM floppy disk images.


 Version 0.45 (2003-10-30):
 --------------------------

- This is just a minor release on the way to version 0.50. It is not very
  well tested, so be warned!
- New build system (with a "configure" shell script).
- A disk image destroying bug in the MSA compression function has been fixed.
- It is now possible to redirect the printer output into a file.
- Experimental MIDI output support.
- Added the possibility to save memory snap shots.
- Pending HBL and VBL interrupts are now emulated correctly (I hope).
- Some speed improvements.
- GEMDOS HD emulation now also works with EmuTOS.


 Version 0.40 (2003-07-11):
 --------------------------

- Support for ZIP and GZIP compressed disk images!
- Configuration file support for loading and saving the emulator settings.
- Hatari now works on machines with Sparc CPUs, too.
- Fixed a problem that slowed down the emulator in monochrome mode when using
  TOS 2.06.
- Inverted monochrome mode is now supported, too (some games like Maniac
  Mansion use this).
- Added Mega-ST compatible real time clock (RTC) emulation.
- The GEMDOS HD emulation has been improved (it now also works with lower-case
  file names) and many bugs have been fixed there.
- Improved keyboard mapping (added mapping via PC keyboard scancode and via
  reloadable mapping files).
- The screen rendering routines have been generalized (less differences between
  windowed and fullscreen mode).
- Hatari can now be cross-compiled, too. You can even compile it for MiNT now.
  However, it does not run very well there yet.
- Support for RAM TOS images.
- Improved memory mapping (the different memory regions should now behave much
  more like on a real ST).
- Improved M68k exceptions (bus errors and exception cycle timings).
- Fixed some bugs in the extended VDI resolution mode (now it is working with
  EmuTOS, too).
- Some games that poll the write-protection signal of the FDC to check for
  disk changes should now be working, too.


 Version 0.30 (2003-03-12):
 --------------------------

- Some parts of the code accessed the SR directly to read the IPL -
  however the UAE CPU core only updates the SR when doing a MakeSR() first.
  So this is done in the affected code parts now, too.
- The IPL wasn't raised when a MFP interrupt occurred - fixed now.
- Full screen resolution for ST-Low can now be selected from the screen setup
  dialog.
- The IKBD emulation does not longer duplicate joystick fire buttons when
  a game tries to use both, joystick and mouse
- Improved audio timer function - the code should now be a little bit faster.
- Resynced Hatari's UAE CPU core with UAE 0.8.22 - this fixes some bugs in 68k
  instructions like ABCD and SBCD.
- Added patches for TOS 2.05 so that this TOS version should now work, too.
- Rewrote TOS patching routine. It is much more flexible now.
- Removed 0xa0ff opcode for VDI resolutions; using GEMDOS_OPCODE now instead.
- Fixed MMU RAM size configuration bug.
- Rewrote some more screen conversion functions in C.
- When a bus or address error occurred, the PC was often not set to the
  right exception handler routine. This has been fixed now.


 Version 0.25 (2002-12-30):
 --------------------------

- Patches for big endian systems (Spectrum 512 pictures are now working there).
- Hatari now also compiles and runs under Mac OS X.
- Blitter emulation has been added.
- There is now the possibility to save YM or WAV sounds.
- Big VDI resolutions (e.g. 800x600) are now supported, too.
- Mouse grab shortcut (AltGr+M).
- Fixed TOS v1.00 patching.


 Version 0.20 (2002-02-18):
 --------------------------

- Added graphical user interface for configuration of the emulator settings.
- Real joysticks can now also be used to simulate the ST joysticks.
- Yet another bugfix for BeOS (lseek again...)
- Support for hard disk images.


 Version 0.11 (2001-10-10):
 --------------------------

- High level (GEMDOS) harddisk emulation.
- ST-Med/ST-Low mixed mode now works.
- Add --compatible CPU mode option.


 Version 0.10 (2001-08-16):
 --------------------------

- Improved CPU cycles emulation.
- Added Spec512 support.
- Some keyboard shortcuts.
- Added the possibility to switch between fullscreen and window mode.
- ST Medium resolution conversion routine.
- Built-in debugger.
- Added possibility to grab screenshots.
- Sound support (not working very well yet).


 Version 0.05 (2001-06-01):
 --------------------------

- Joystick emulation via cursor keys.
- ST-LOW resolution conversion routine is now working on big-endian machines.


 Version 0.04 (2001-05-27):
 --------------------------

- Added Stefan Berndtsson's patch for big-endian machines.
  Hatari now runs also with non-x86 Linux machines! Thanks Stefan!
- Rewrote the ST-LOW resolution conversion routines in C ==> ST-LOW now works!
- Added some of the WinSTon patches Paul Bates recently published
  at the WinSTon BBS (Thanks to Ladislav Adamec for the hint).
- Cleaned up the source tree a little bit.


 Version 0.03 (2001-04-03):
 --------------------------

- Rewrote some more assembler functions. FDC emulation now works!
- SDL Keyboard code finished and included a SDL-Key -> ST-Scancode table.
- Added mouse support.


 Version 0.02 (2001-03-28):
 --------------------------

- Added very simple SDL support.
- Rewrote a lot of assembler functions in C (e.g. intercept.c).
- Adapted the UAE CPU. Now Hatari is able to boot a TOS 1.0x ROM, the
  Desktop shows up, but no mouse and keyboard interaction yet.


 Version 0.01 (2001-03-21):
 --------------------------
- Made the WinSTon source code compilable with GNU-C.
- Added the UAE CPU sources.
