.SH NAME
zip2st \- convert directory or .zip archive to .st disk image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zip2st
.RI <directory|srcname.zip>
.RI [dstname.st]
.SH DESCRIPTION
zip2st can be used to generate Atari .st disk image from directory
and .zip archive contents.
.PP
If the destination filename is not given, it's based on the source
name, with the .zip extension removed and .st prefix added. If
\fIbasename\fP tool is present, file is saved to current directory,
otherwise to the directory where the source directory/archive is.
.PP
Any single directories (other than 'auto') within the source zip /
directory hierarchy are traversed down, to avoid adding redundant
intermediate directories to the generated disk image.
.PP
The .st disk image is a raw disk image, and can be written to a floppy
using dd(1), or converted to a .msa disk image with \fIhmsa\fP(1).
.PP
The contents of the uncompressed zip file needs to be smaller than
2.88MB (the largest floppy image size supported by Hatari).
.PP
If the source file names are longer than 8+3, use \fIatari\-convert\-dir\fP
script to convert them into Atari compatible ones.  If the files are
within a .zip archive, you need to extract them before conversion.
